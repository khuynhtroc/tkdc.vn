## 1. Continuous water supply

### 1.1 Have a full bowl of water ready for your dog. 

This is obvious but an extremely important step. [first]
- If your dog finishes the water bowl in a short time, replace the larger bowl or prepare more bowls of water.
- If you live with other people, make a schedule to remind everyone to check and change water during the day.

### 1.2 Make room for your dog to play and bathe in the water. 

Have a small tank or water tank to let your dog cool down in the yard. [2] Pets also enjoy running in a fountain.
- The tank should not be too deep and may drown the pet. The dog should stand on the bottom of the tank with the head above the water.

### 1.3 Bring water for a walk. 

While walking the dog in harsh weather, bring water for yourself and your pet as well. If your dog is gasping or seems sluggish, stop in the shade and give him water.
- If the dog does not drink, you can pour water over them.

## 2. Cool down your dog

### 2.1 Keep the dog indoors. 

Take your dog into the coolest room in the house when it's at its peak outside. [3] If you have air conditioning in your home, leave it on all day while your dog is alone.
- Each dog can tolerate different temperatures, but most will experience heat shock when the temperature rises to 27 to 29 degrees Celsius. If the temperature fluctuates within this range, you should turn on the air conditioner when in home alone. Adjust the temperature down to 24 to 26 degrees Celsius. [4]
- This step is especially important when the weather is wet. The humidity in the air makes it difficult for a dog to cool down by panting. [5]
- If the temperature is cool and comfortable for your pet, you can take your dog to the basement. [6]

### 2.2 Provide plenty of shade for your dog. 

Prepare a cool crate or cover the porch so your dog can rest outside.
- If your dog is outside during the day, you can buy a parasol, or make a canopy with a thin blanket.

### 2.3 Provide a heat cushion for your dog. 

You can choose from a variety of cushions that are designed to cool your dog. Most contain a gel that transfers heat from the dog's body. [7]
- You can place a damp cloth on the kitchen floor. If the dog is lying on a towel, it will feel cool.

![Keep-a-Dog-Cool-in-Hot-Weather-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-cool-your-dog-in-the-summer/v4-728px-Keep-a-Dog-Cool-in-Hot-Weather-Step-7-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 Avoid midday walks. 

Take your dog for a walk early in the morning and at night when the temperature is low. If it is especially hot and / or humid, take a break from walking your dog. [8]
- Take the dog for a walk in a cool, shady place. Both you and your pet will feel comfortable walking in this area. You can take your dog for a walk on the beach or river with a cool breeze if you live near that area.
- Take control of your dog's activities by leashes them. This will help prevent your pet from accessing high heat.
- Do not let your pet's paws touch hot pavement. Sidewalks get very hot in hot weather, and if dogs come into contact with the surface, their feet can burn. [9] You should let your dog walk on grass if possible, and limit exposure to concrete on pavement. To check the safety of the sidewalk so your dog can walk on it, place your palms on the ground. If your hand is burned, avoid letting your dog walk on it or wearing protective shoes.
- If you cannot touch the pavement for at least 15 seconds, do not take your dog for a walk on the sidewalk until the temperature has cooled.

### 2.5 Get the dog to trim the fur. 

This step is especially important for long, thick hair. Note, however, that the hairs regrow after cutting.
- Keep in mind that the groomer will not shave the dog completely. Exposing the skin surface can cause skin burns.

### 2.6 Do not leave your dog in a car in the sun. 

This is extremely dangerous because the temperature in the car can rise very quickly and kill the dog. [10] Also you could get into trouble with animal protection and police welfare.
- Always keep your dog's window open in the car, and keep drinking water with you.
- In many US states, especially California, it is illegal to leave a pet in a car in hot weather. [11] [twelfth]
- Turn on your car's air-conditioner to keep the temperature below 26 degrees Celsius. If your car doesn't have one, leave your dog at home when it's hot outside. [13]

### 2.7 Check with your dog regularly. 

On extremely hot days, watch your dog's condition closely. If anything is unusual, such as the dog panting too much, contact your vet.
- If your dog shows signs of heat stroke, take him out of a sunny area, give him water, and cool him down.
- If you think your dog has heatstroke, learn how to overcome the heat stroke in your dog.

## 3. Cool down the dog with heat stroke

### 3.1 Take your dog's rectal temperature. 

The rectum is the hole just below the dog's tail. Apply grease or water-based lubricant to the tip of the thermometer before use. [14]
- If a dog's body temperature is 40 degrees C or higher, he is suffering from heat stroke and needs immediate medical help.
- While calling your veterinarian or veterinarian, you'll need to take action to cool down. Don't cool off too suddenly, and all hypothermia measures should be stopped when the temperature reaches 38 degrees Celsius. Excessive cooling down can cause more complications. [15]

![Keep-a-Dog-Cool-in-Hot-Weather-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-cool-your-dog-in-the-summer/v4-728px-Keep-a-Dog-Cool-in-Hot-Weather-Step-12-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Cool the dog's body. 

You can use a spray or place your dog in a tub of water that is cool but not too cold. [16]
- Sudden changes in temperature can harm your dog. Do not cool down too quickly with ice.
- The water should seep under the dog's belly, between his legs, and under the tail.

![Keep-a-Dog-Cool-in-Hot-Weather-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-cool-your-dog-in-the-summer/v4-728px-Keep-a-Dog-Cool-in-Hot-Weather-Step-13-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Offer chilled food. 

You can give your dog some cold food, but not too much at once (eg ice) as this can shock the dog.
- You can freeze low-sodium beef or chicken broth or appealing liquid onto an ice tray to make frozen treats for your dog. [17] On hot days, your dog may just kick it normally.
- Do not pour water or ice into the dog's throat. This can cause water to flow into the lungs causing other complications such as pneumonia or death.

![Keep-a-Dog-Cool-in-Hot-Weather-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-cool-your-dog-in-the-summer/v4-728px-Keep-a-Dog-Cool-in-Hot-Weather-Step-14-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Place a damp cloth on the dog's paws. 

Alternatively, you can lay a wet cloth over their body to cool them down.
- You can also use an ice pack or a cold vegetable towel to place the skin on the inside of the dog's front and back legs, and the back of the dog's nape. These are the areas where the most blood vessels are concentrated. Cooling the amount of blood under an ice pack can cool down your pet.

### 3.5 Apply rubbing alcohol to the dog's feet. 

Alcohol evaporates quickly and reduces heat as it evaporates. [18]
- Only use this remedy occasionally. Using too much alcohol can dry out the pet's paws. [19]

![Keep-a-Dog-Cool-in-Hot-Weather-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-cool-your-dog-in-the-summer/v4-728px-Keep-a-Dog-Cool-in-Hot-Weather-Step-16-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.6 Contact your veterinarian if you notice warning signs. 

Signs of heat stroke include: [20] :
- Extreme gasping
- The tongue is bright red or enlarged
- Sluggish motion
- Unresponsive or slow to respond
- Advice
- Install a fan or vent device next to your dog and place a bowl of cool water nearby.
- Place bowls and buckets of water in the shade and sanitize daily. Change the water at least once a day and change several times if the water becomes contaminated.
- Add ice to the water to help cool the dog.

> Warning
- If you notice that your dog is panting nonstop, he may experience a heat shock. You need to spray them with cool water or put them in a tub of water. If you take your dog to the doctor, wrap him in a cool, absorbent towel to cool down.
- Maintain a normal weight for your dog. [21] Obese animals are not able to withstand high temperatures and are at risk of heat stroke.
- Short-haired breeds such as bulldogs and pummels are susceptible to heat stroke. The shape of the face makes it difficult to breathe under normal conditions and is very dangerous if the weather becomes hot. You should keep your pet indoors with air conditioning in the summer. [22]
