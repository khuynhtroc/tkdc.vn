title: "How to determine a dog's sex?"
summary: Sex of adult dogs can be determined quite easily by observing their body and behavior. However, for dogs younger than 6 months old this will be more difficult. In order to determine the sex of your puppy, you will need to observe their body closely to distinguish the type of genitals. You can also use their behavior to tell the difference, but based on the characteristics of the body will be more reliable.

## 1. Be careful when examining newborn puppies

### 1.1 Wait a few weeks before checking. 

The larger the puppies, the easier it will be to check their sex. You should wait until the dog is at least 3-4 weeks old before conducting the test, at which point the accuracy will be higher. [first]
- It is easiest to wait for the dog to turn 8 weeks, and after 8 weeks, the male dog's external genitals have become quite obvious.
- If your puppy still has umbilical cord, look about 1 cm behind the umbilical cord to see if you can see a penis. During the first few weeks after giving birth, the puppy's penis looks like a small lump floating in the middle of the abdomen. Unlike male dogs, female dogs do not have an external genitalia on the abdomen.

### 1.2 Pick up the dog carefully. 

Newborn puppies are very soft, so be very gentle when you lift them. Before touching them, you need to wash and dry your hands; Be gentle and keep your dog careful to avoid accidental injury.[2]
- Make sure the mother is comfortable when you touch the puppies. Some mothers can become very aggressive when a stranger touches their baby.
- If the puppies or the mother appear to be concerned, return the puppies to the mother and have the test done at another time.

### 1.3 Keep the puppies warm. 

Check the dog's sex in a warm place to avoid catching a cold, and make sure your hands are warm when handling the puppy. If they get cold, they get sick easily.[3]
- You should also only test your dog for 5 to 10 minutes. Keeping your dog out for too long will make it too cold.
- If the puppy starts to shiver or moan, return it to the mother or put it in a warm nest.

### 1.4 Put the puppy on his back. 

You can lay a clean, soft washcloth on a fixed surface for the dog to lie on or hold the dog in hand and examine. Carefully lift the puppy and place it on its back to observe its abdomen.
- You should only keep the dog lying on his back in his hand when it is small and willing to lie down.
- Don't forget to support the dog's head while holding it on its back.
- If you put your dog on a towel, use a warm towel. If necessary, put the towel in the dryer for a few minutes before placing the dog on it. Do not use cold, hot, or damp towels.

### 1.5 Distinguish the penis from the umbilical cord. 

When determining the sex of a puppy, many people mistake the umbilical cord for a penis. They all look like a small lump on the dog's belly, but the dog's umbilical cord (navel) is just below the ribs, and the penis is deeper down, between the hind legs. [4]
- Also, be aware that both male and female dogs will have at least one bulge on the abdomen as they both have a belly button. The male dog will have one more lump in the space between the navel and hind legs. On the other hand, a male dog has only one hole under the tail, a female dog will have two.
- It is best to seek help from a veterinarian, breeder, or canine specialist if you want to determine the sex of your dog when it is very young.

## 2. Examination of external genitals

### 2.2 Find the male dog's genitals. 

Look for the area between the dog's belly and tail for his penis and scrotum. In adult dogs, these parts are very clearly visible, but in puppies they are very small and almost non-existent. [5]
- The scrotum is just below the anal opening, mostly between the hind legs.
- Male dogs that have been desexed and are no longer fertile will have no scrotum.

### 2.2 Find the bitch's genitals. 

If the puppy is a bitch, you should see the dog's pussy when it is lying on its back. Gently separate the dog's hind legs until you have located your vulva. On the anus, between your hind legs, you will see a leaf-like part, which is the bitch's pussy. [6]

### 2.3 Know if your dog is pregnant . 

To confirm that the dog is a bitch, you can observe whether it is pregnant or not. The pregnant dog will have a large belly, even though the diet will not change and will give birth.

### 2.4 Avoid using other physical features to determine the dog's sex. 

You will be more inclined to rely on other traits to identify your dog's sex; however, male and female dogs are not very different or difficult to discern unless you are an expert in your breed. These very vague differences are not the same in different breeds of dogs, so it is best to distinguish male and female dogs from other characteristics. [7]
- For example, both male and female dogs have nipples, so assuming that dogs are female dogs may be inaccurate. [8]
- Also, due to species characteristics, dogs can be large or muscular, but not necessarily a male. Female dogs and male dogs usually do not differ much in body size.

## 3. Recognize your behavioral differences

### 3.1 Observe the urge to pee when your dog is at least 6 months old. 

Both female dogs and male dogs, when they are young, have similar urination patterns. However, after 6 months of age, most male dogs will lift their legs when urinating, while the female dog will remain squatting. [9]
- Your puppy will not be able to control her pee during the first few weeks, so you won't be able to use the pee method to determine the dog's sex at this time.
- Even if the puppies are strong enough to stand and control their habits, they will squat and urinate around the first 2 months of life.
- Many puppies need to be 6 months old to develop the urination habits of adult dogs.

### 3.2 Watch out for territorial marking behavior. 

By the time the male dog is around a few months old, he or she will begin to show territorial behavior. This is a sign of behavior that can be used for fairly obvious sexism, since puppies do not have this instinct.
- The territorial marker instinct is particularly strong in puppies that have not been spayed and will be significantly reduced after castration.
- Puppies will begin to have territorial marking behavior at different ages depending on the puppy, but most will start between 2 and 6 months of age.
- Dogs often mark their territory when they pee quickly in a variety of places, especially when they urinate intentionally after sniffing each spot carefully.
- Dogs that pee only once or twice are usually not territorial markers, although they may stop to smell different places while walking.

### 3.3 Watch for signs of heat in the bitch. 

Unspayed bitches will go into heat twice a year. The first cycle of heat will occur when the dog is 6 to 10 months old, each cycle will last about 3 weeks. Signs of a bitch in heat include changes in behavior, erections, and vaginal discharge. [ten]
- Female dogs tend to be restless and clingy when they go into heat. [11]
- A female in heat will have clear, brown or bloody vaginal discharge depending on the time of her breeding cycle.

### 3.4 Do not rely on personality or general behavior to determine the sex of the dog. 

Both male and female dogs can be equally emotional, defensive, active, and calm. These personality traits say nothing about their gender. [twelfth]
- For example, even jumping up mating behavior, which is commonly thought to be common in male dogs, is demonstrated in female dogs.[13]

> Advice
- Regular handling of puppies under 3 weeks of age can cause them to have too much human breath. If the puppies smell too much like "human smell" the mother will probably abandon them. At the same time, holding the puppies too much puts them at greater risk of catching colds and getting sick.
- Remember that both male and female dogs have mammals, so you cannot rely on this trait to distinguish between their sex.
