> The Dachshund (pronounced DAK-sund) is a short-legged and long-back breed compared to other breeds. They are derived from the German hound. (The name "dachshund" means "badger dog.") In order to properly take care of dachshunds, you need to meet their special needs, including a nature with a herniated disc herniation. Dachshund needs to maintain a normal body mass, good hygiene, and good habit training. This article will show you how to take care of your dachshund.

## 1. Protect the dachshund's back

### 1.1 Note that dachshunds are susceptible to disc herniation (IVDD). 

Like other small breeds of dogs, the dachshund has an increased risk of disc herniation. With IVDD, the gills between the vertebrae rupture or bulge, putting pressure on the vertebrae. IVDD can cause pain, bladder control problems, and even paralysis. To reduce the risk of IVDD in dachshund, special care is needed. Also you should be aware of some of the symptoms of IVDD in dachshund to detect problems early. See your veterinarian right away if you notice any of the following symptoms:
- Change level of activity, no longer run and jump like before
- Stand up hard
- crying in pain
- change in behavior, anxiety and fear
- bend back and neck and / or squeeze back and neck muscles
- little or no food
- loss of bladder and / or bowel control [1]

### 1.2 Helps dachshund maintain a healthy body mass. 

Being overweight can put dachshunds at higher risk for IVDD, so you need to feed them properly and exercise plenty. To determine the right body weight, stand tall above the pet and look down. If you see ribs, the dog is too thin and needs to gain weight. If you can't see the ribs but still feel it, your pet has a healthy body mass. In case you can't see or feel the ribs, the dog is overweight. Dachshund needs a slim waist instead of a dangling belly. [2]
- Talk to your veterinarian to determine if the volume needs to be reduced or increased. In addition, your doctor will also teach you how to feed the dog appropriately so that the dog can get and maintain his body weight.
- Take the dachshund for a walk and play with them every day.
- Offer moderate snacks.
- Consider giving dachshund weight maintenance foods if they're too fat.

### 1.3 Learn how to carry a dachshund. 

Correct handling of dogs helps to protect their back. You need to support the edge of the body with one hand and thread the other hand under the abdomen to support the dachshund's back.
- Do not hold a dachshund with one hand or hold the paws or head.

### 1.4 Help the dachshund dog up and down stairs. 

Climbing stairs increases the pressure on the dachshund's back and over time they can suffer from IVDD. Normal terraces are too high for this breed and put pressure on their back as they climb or descend stairs. [3]
- Install small gates to prevent dachshund from climbing up or down stairs.
- Consider installing a ramp for a small staircase for daily commutes. [4]

### 1.5 Prevent dachshund from jumping onto furniture or high areas. 

Running and jumping also puts pressure on the dachshund's back and increases the risk of IVDD. To eliminate this risk factor, do not let the dachshund jump high like a sofa or bed. If you want the dachshund to jump on your lap, you should actively lift them. Do not encourage your pet to jump on its own.
- Consider placing some boards as a slope if you want the dachshund to be able to jump onto furniture when you're not at home. [5]

### 1.6 Use the harness to walk the dachshund. 

If your dog pulls around while you take him for a walk, he puts more pressure on his vertebrae causing IVDD. Attach the dog leash to the harness instead of the collar to reduce the pressure on the pet's neck and other types of IVDD risk sets. [6]

## 2. Train dachshund dogs

### 2.1 Take a short training session. 

For best results, train your dachshund three times a day with five minutes each. Short training helps the dachshund stay focused. Regularity helps reinforce lessons for your pet. [7]

### 2.2 Reward good behavior. 

To get your dachshund to obey a command, you need to reward the proper behavior as soon as it is done. For example, if you want the dachshund to sit down and they do, give him a treat and cuddle now to let him know he did a good thing. You should reward dachshunds every time you follow an order so they know that these are the behaviors you desire. [8]

### 2.3 Ignore bad behavior. 

By ignoring improper behavior or withdrawing a reward, you are helping dachshund understand actions you do not want. For example, if the dachshund wants to go for a walk and he or she is running around because he feels excited, ignore it until the dog stops to bring it back. When the dachshund stops and stands still, you bring the reins in and take them for a walk. Do this every time you prepare to take the dog for a walk to let them understand that this is something you don't want. Then your pet will understand that if you run around, you will not be able to walk, but if you stand still, you will be able to walk. [9]

### 2.4 Consider hiring a qualified dog trainer. 

If you're having trouble getting your dachshund to obey commands, you might consider hiring a professional to help you train your pet. A qualified dog trainer can assist you in training this breed. This is especially helpful if you are trying to correct your pet's bad behavior. [ten]
- Alternatively you can sign up for a local group training course if you want your dachshund to learn to communicate with the world around you.

## 3. Sanitize dachshunds

### 3.1 Bathe the dachshund dog. 

Use a shampoo specifically designed for dogs to bathe the dachshund. If your dog has short hairs, you should bathe them every three months. For long-haired dogs, you need to bathe more often. Use the spray to moisten the dog's fur, but not around the eyes, ears, and nose. Then apply shampoo on the pet's fur. Rinse off the shampoo and dry with a towel. [11]
- Praise and reward the dachshunds after bathing so they associate the act of bathing with the good experience.

### 3.2 Groom the dachshund. 

If the dachshund has short hairs, you only need to brush once a week. As with long-haired dogs, you need to brush every day so that the coat is not messed up. Use a thin comb to untangle before using the brush. While grooming, give your dog a great compliment and reward the food after the work is done so that the pet associates brushing with the good. [twelfth]

### 3.3 Cut your dog's nails. 

To trim your dachshund's nails, you will need a special dog clipper that can be found at pet stores. Also, get used to getting dachshund accustomed to touching your nails before starting to cut. If your dog is alert when you touch his paws and claws, stroke his paws and his toes to get used to it first. Praise and reward the food when your pet lets you touch your toes. After they are comfortable with the touch of the foot, you can begin a nail clipping. [13]
- Do not cut too deeply as it may touch the meat cushion. This is a very sensitive area and may bleed.
- If you are concerned about hurting your dog during a nail clipping, ask your veterinarian for instructions on how to make it, or bring the pet to a hygienist to trim the dog's nails.

### 3.4 Check out the problem. 

During the dog's cleaning, you can check for fleas, ticks, and other potential health problems. Also check your dog's skin for abnormalities, wounds, or areas that are sore. Don't forget to check your ears for wax build up and unpleasant odors. If you notice anything unusual, take your dog to see the vet promptly. [14]

> Advice
- Take your pet for regular check-ups (twice a year) to ensure health and full vaccination.

> Warning
- Consider purchasing pet health insurance. Dachshunds are brave and reckless dogs, a trait that makes them susceptible to problems leading to two options: surgery or restraint of the dog.
- Dogs that do not know humans and their fellow humans often bark, growl, and even bite. You should let the dachshund interact with dogs and strangers from small to large.
- Dachshunds' nails are dark in color, so be careful when trimming them thin. Do not cut the meat pad (blood vessels in the nail).
- Do not let dachshunds become overweight as this can affect back and health.
