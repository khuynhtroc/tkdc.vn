title: "How to prevent dogs from barking at other dogs?"
summary: In dogs, barking is a natural way of communication. A dog can bark for a variety of reasons, such as to draw attention, play, and alert to danger. However, when your dog barks at other dogs, this behavior is troublesome, at least annoying. If your dog often barks when he sees other dogs, train it, and try different strategies to stop the habit.

## 1. Prevent your dog from barking by relaxing

### 1.1 Keep the dog away from other dogs. 

If your dog is barking madly when chained or separated behind a fence, it is in a state of "barrier aggression" - the dog is angry at being obstructed by the barrier. To appease the dog and reduce its aggression, hold the leash, and lead him close enough to see the other dog but far enough away that it will not react. 
- Choose a place where people often take their dogs, such as a dog park or pet store. 
- You may have to experiment at first to find out how far away you have to lead the dog. If you go to the pet store you may need to stand on the edge of the parking lot or on a far sidewalk. If you go to a dog park, take your dog to the edge or at a corner of the park.

### 1.2 Reward your dog. 

When your dog sees another dog but is not barking or reacting, reward him with a treat. Instead of giving the dog a large bite, feed your dog in small chunks as long as he sees the other dog but is unresponsive. Not only is this feeding your dog a sustained reward, but it can also help distract your dog during passing.
- Stop feeding the dog after the other dog has passed. Be sure to reduce the amount of food your dog will eat during meals to subtract it from the rewards you gave him during training. 
- As your dog has improved during training, replace the treats with praise and cuddling.
- Watch for signs that the dog is about to bark (growling, the hair on the neck raised, staring). The goal here is to give the dog a treat before it starts barking or reacting.
- As this process is repeated over and over again, your dog will begin to count on you for a reward for not barking or reacting to other dogs.

### 1.3 Use additional voice tags. 

In addition to rewarding your dog with a treat, you can use a voice command to direct its attention to you and forget the dog. Choose a short phrase like ("look at me") or a one-word voice tag ("focus", "look") and give it a command every time your dog sees another dog. Give the voice command before giving the dog a reward so that it associates the voice tag with the reward.
- It is important that you and your family consistently use voice commands so that your dog knows when not to bark.

### 1.4 Get the dog closer. 

Challenge your dog by getting it closer to the other dog gradually (also getting closer to the pet store or park entrance). If your dog starts to react and bark, take it back and then try to come closer again. Try moving a few feet forward during each training session. Continue to reward your dog as it did before it did not bark or react.
- You may have to improvise as your dog gets closer. For example, if you are at a pet store, you may need to adjust your standing position on the sidewalk or in the parking lot.

### 1.5 Practice every day. 

Daily exercise is essential to keeping your dog from barking at other dogs. To keep your dog's attention focused, limit the duration of each training session to 5-10 minutes. Training sessions should be fun with lots of positive reinforcement (palate, praise, petting). 

## 2. Prevent your dog from barking during a walk

### 2.1 Drive the dog on a sturdy leash or flap. 

Walking a dog should be a pleasant experience, not a struggle to prevent the dog from barking or rushing to attack other dogs. When you walk your dog on a sturdy leash or harness, it will be easier to control it if it barks or is about to rush to the other dog. A non-tight harness is best because it will not hurt your dog when you need to pull it away or pull it back.
- Your first reaction is usually to pull back and hold the leash tightly. However, this action can cause dogs to increasingly want to pull back. You should hold the cord firmly, but not too tight. 
- During a walk, if you have to take your dog away, be sure not to leash.

### 2.2 Choose another place to walk. 

There are many ways to prevent dogs from barking at other dogs while for a walk, and the simplest way is to find another location. This will give your dog no incentive to bark. Try to find an open space and not too crowded so that your dog can relax more while walking. 

![Stop-a-Dog-Barking-at-Other-Dogs-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-prevent-dogs-from-barking-at-other-dogs/v4-728px-Stop-a-Dog-Barking-at-Other-Dogs-Step-8.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Move the dog away from the other dog. 

If you can't find another place to walk your dog, you'll need to find other ways to prevent the dog from barking when another dog approaches. For example, when you see another dog coming, turn around, and take your dog away from the other dog. If possible, do this before your dog realizes that there is another dog - don't wait until your dog responds. 
- Turn to the standing dog and make a small nudge to signal it to return with you.
- Teach your dog to return to the command. Shout out voice commands ("turn", "turn back"), and use your favorite food to lure your dog back. Whit the right training and rewards, your dog will learn this command.
- Call out the dog's name to get its attention, then run or walk backward when you face it. This will cause your dog to focus on you as you create some distance between him and the other dog.

### 2.4 Distract your dog. 

If you can distract your dog from the other, it will either stop barking or will not bark at first. One way to distract your dog is to throw a treat on the ground. When another dog passes by, perhaps your dog is still busy picking up his favorite food from the ground, so he doesn't pay attention to the other dog. 
- You can also bring a dog toy to distract it.

### 2.5 Command your dog to stay close to you. 

When another dog approaches, your dog may be tempted to bark and rush to the other dog. Ordering your dog to follow you will prevent it from coming. Reward the dog when it is standing close to you. 
- Note that your dog may still be unable to suppress the barking, even if you control its movement.

![Stop-a-Dog-Barking-at-Other-Dogs-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-prevent-dogs-from-barking-at-other-dogs/v4-728px-Stop-a-Dog-Barking-at-Other-Dogs-Step-11.jpg.webp)

### 2.6 Create more challenges while walking. 

These challenges force the dog to focus more on you instead of on the other dog. For example, if you would normally walk your dog on a flat road, you can now choose a steep road. You can also challenge the dog by giving it a surprise when it goes for a walk: change speed or direction, walk around bushes or a tree stump, up and down the curb (provided no car run over). 
- Choose a challenge that your dog will enjoy. 

## 3. Prevent your dog from barking at home

![Stop-a-Dog-Barking-at-Other-Dogs-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-prevent-dogs-from-barking-at-other-dogs/v4-728px-Stop-a-Dog-Barking-at-Other-Dogs-Step-12.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Teach your dog the "talk" and "silent" commands. 

If your dog is barking at other dogs in front of your house, you can prevent this by controlling its barking behavior. First, you need to teach your dog the command "to speak". Use a command to "talk" and do something that causes the dog to bark, such as knocking on the door. A few hours after the dog has barked, hold the treat above the dog's nose, and reward it when it stops barking to sniff the treat.
- Once your dog has learned how to bark when you say the command "say", teach him the command "shut up" to stop barking. Hold another treat in front of the dog's nose and feed it when it stops barking. With regular practice, your dog will stop barking at other dogs when you say "shut". 
- Ideally, you should teach the command "to shut up" where there are no distractions. You can then practice this command where your dog is likely to see or hear other dogs.
- Don't yell "shut up". If you scold, your dog will think you barked as well!

### 3.2 Get your dog to do another activity. 

The goal here is to have the dog do something the opposite of barking. For example, when your dog starts barking, tell him to pretend to be dead or roll around. Neither of these games allows the dog to bark. Additionally, the dog will not be able to bark at the expense of these cues.

![Stop-a-Dog-Barking-at-Other-Dogs-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-prevent-dogs-from-barking-at-other-dogs/v4-728px-Stop-a-Dog-Barking-at-Other-Dogs-Step-14.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Block your dog's access. 

If you keep your dog out in a fenced-in yard, the sight and sound of other dogs may stimulate it to bark. You can prevent this by bringing your dog inside to block its access. Once your dog is in, you can keep the curtains or blinds closed. 
- If your dog cannot see or hear the dog, it will have no objects left to bark.
- The dog can participate in the "fence war", it will run back and forth along the fence and bark to chase the other dog away. This behavior may be pleasant for the dog, but it is probably not pleasant for you, for the dog and its owner. Get your dog inside if it starts to do so.

### 3.4 Give your dog something to play with. 

As with walks, pastimes can draw your dog's attention away from the other. Food toys are a great pastime, as the dog can focus on it and play for a long time. You can also play games with your dogs, such as hide-and-seek or pick-up, to distract it. 

![Stop-a-Dog-Barking-at-Other-Dogs-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-prevent-dogs-from-barking-at-other-dogs/v4-728px-Stop-a-Dog-Barking-at-Other-Dogs-Step-16.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Open "white noise". 

White noise is the background sound. While there is nothing to attract the dog's attention, the white noise will help drown out the tinkling of the tag or the call of the dog walking outside. If you notice your dog is starting to stare out the window and about to bark (if it hasn't barked yet), turn on some white noise (eg television, radio, etc.).
- The tinkling of the tag and the squeaking of other dogs can be a trigger for barking.
- When your dog stops barking, give him the treat to reward him for stopping barking.

> Advice
- The adrenaline released when a dog barks will make him happy. Your dog may enjoy barking at other dogs, but this behavior is not recommended.
- It can take days to weeks to teach your dog not to bark at other dogs. The longer the behavior occurs, the longer it will take to break the habit.
- If you find yourself tightening the leash when you see another dog, compensate with a treat. This allows the dog to be positively associated with a behavior that may make it easier for the dog to bark at the other dog.
- Before taking your dog for a walk, you might want to consider making the dog a little tired with a pick-up game. Your dog will be less likely to bark at other dogs if he becomes tired.
- Keep calm when walking your dog. If you are stressed, your dog will feel that mood and will be stressed too. 
- Contact your vet or animal behavior specialist if you are unable to stop your dog from barking at other dogs. 

> Warning
- If not handled right away, the dog's barking and aggressive behavior towards other dogs may get worse.
- Adrenaline can cause your dog to quickly go from excitement to aggression. In addition, excitement in some situations (at dog parks, dog salons) can cause your dog to react more strongly in other situations.
- Don't shout "No!" when the dog is barking. To a dog, your screams sound like a bark. 
- Your dog's improper barking can be caused by an underlying medical problem. Take your dog to the veterinarian to rule out the health cause of his barking behavior problems.
