> Your dog will become dehydrated if more water is lost from the body than the dog drinks. For example, a dog with a stomach ache may become dehydrated through diarrhea or vomiting, thus risking dehydration quickly. In addition, there are many other reasons leading to dehydration in dogs. For example, if the dog does not drink a lot of water on hot days, the dog can become dehydrated quickly. [1] The first step in treating your dog is to recognize dehydration by making sure the dog is drinking enough water or seeing the vet.

## 1. Check for signs of dehydration

### 1.1 Pay attention to your dog's behavior. 

Dehydrated dogs often use their remaining strength to find water to drink. If the dog is dehydrated, you may notice unusual behavior in the dog, such as restlessness or pacing, like looking for water to drink. [2]
- Your dog may be constantly licking his lips or / and showing apparent facial anxiety if he cannot find enough water to drink. [3]
- Dehydrated dogs can also lie with their nose resting on the water bowl. [4]

### 1.2 Check the dog's nape. 

The basic dehydration test that you often see veterinarians do in the clinic is to pull the nape of the dog. This test can measure skin elasticity, and a loss of elasticity can indicate dehydration. You can perform this test yourself by doing the following:
- Locate the dog's nape. The back of the dog is the drooping area of ​​the skin over the dog's shoulder or neck.
- Raise the nape of the dog. You can grab this area of ​​skin and gently pull it up 5-7 cm above the dog's back.
- Release your neck and watch. If you stay hydrated, your skin will return to its original position immediately. If dehydrated, the skin becomes less elastic and cannot immediately return to its original position.
- If the skin takes more than 2 seconds to return to normal, the dog may be dehydrated. [5]

### 1.3 Check your dog's gums. 

The gums are a good place to check for early dehydration in your dog. Normal gums will be moist and shiny just like human gums. Dehydrated animals often have dry or slightly sticky gums because they do not produce enough saliva. [6]
- Be aware that anxious or frightened dogs may also have dry gums. Therefore, be sure to check the gums when the dog is truly relaxed to avoid confusion. [7]

### 1.4 Check your dog's urine. 

If your dog does not drink enough water, his body can automatically take steps to retain water. In this situation, the dog will not urinate because the bladder is empty or the urine becomes concentrated. Concentrated urine is usually a dark yellow color. [8]
- This is because the dog's kidneys are overworked to recycle water in the body and retain water. [9]
- Be careful if your dog pee less than usual or if his urine is abnormally colored.

### 1.5 Take the dog to see the vet. 

If your dog appears healthy and shows only simple signs of dehydration, such as drinking water from a bowl, give him more water and see if the condition improves. However, if the dehydrated dog seems sick or the condition does not improve after drinking the water, you should see your vet immediately. [ten]
- Some dehydrated animals need intravenous fluids to protect the function of their internal organs during rehydration. [11]

## 2. Be aware of your risk factors for dehydration

### 2.1 Pay attention to your dog's water supply. 

There are many situations in which a dog becomes dehydrated, and the easiest way to manage dehydration is to observe the dog's access to water.
- If the water bowl is completely empty or is empty and is not refilled for a long time, the dog may become dehydrated. Make sure your dog is getting enough fluids, especially on hot days. [twelfth]
- Dehydration can develop rapidly and can sometimes occur within an hour or so, depending on the ambient temperature. [13]

### 2.2 Make sure your dog drinks water regularly. 

Even if your dog has access to water, it can become dehydrated if it doesn't drink enough water regularly. You should keep an eye on it to make sure your dog is drinking continuously.
- For example, older dogs with arthritis often experience pain when getting up to drink water after each thirst, and will also be at risk of dehydration. [14]
- Dehydration can be exacerbated if the dog has certain conditions such as diabetes or kidney disease because the body tends to produce too much urine. The rate of dehydration of dogs with these diseases will be faster than healthy dogs. This is a chronic form of dehydration that can slowly develop over a few days and there is a risk of recurrence. [15]
- Similarly, anorexia dog that does not want to eat or drink is also at risk of dehydration.

### 2.3 Note when your dog has diarrhea. 

Liquid stools usually contain a lot of water, so the loss of water will occur faster and increase the risk of dehydration. [16]
- If your dog drinks enough fluids, the risk of dehydration is reduced. However, if the dog refuses to find water to drink or does not want to drink water, the dog can become dehydrated quickly when suffering from diarrhea. [17]

### 2.4 Watch out if your dog is vomiting. 

Vomiting is a serious problem because the dog is unable to retain all of the water it has ingested. [18]
- Watch closely if your dog is vomiting and contact your veterinarian if you suspect that your dog is dehydrated or if your dog is vomiting constantly.

> Advice
- If you think your dog is thirsty or dehydrated, don't wait for the symptoms to appear. Instead, just fill the bowl with water every time the water level drops.
- The best way to prevent and cure dehydration is to make sure your dog drinks plenty of clean water at all times. [19]

> Warning
- If your dog appears weak, tired, and / or does not drink or the dehydration does not improve after drinking the water, you should see the vet.
- Untreated dehydration can lead to organ failure and death.
