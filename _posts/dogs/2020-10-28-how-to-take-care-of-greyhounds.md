> The Beagle is an easy, friendly animal that requires constant training and care. They have their origins as hunting dogs, so when kept on their own, they enjoy exploring things with their hearing noses all day long. Before you get a puppy to hunt rabbits, you need to be prepared for this breed of hyperactivity. [1] Good care for greyhounds not only involves meeting their basic needs, but also providing opportunities for training, caring, and mental stimulation.

## 1. Prepare to take the puppy home

### 1.1 Learn about the common characteristics of the greyhound. 

Remember that this is a hound. By understanding their habits, you can satisfy your puppy's need (both mentally and physically) to be a good, happy, and happy dog. [2]
- For example, the breed's nature is to hunt rabbits, so they are very inquisitive and nuzzle anything regardless of whether it is related to them or not.

### 1.2 Clean up furniture. 

Before you bring your puppy home, you need to clean all the household items. Pick up any rubbish that is lying on the floor, personal belongings, non-puppy or adult food, and any objects the puppy can swallow and / or choke on. In general, you need to clean the house because the puppies will discover everything they come across.

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-3]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-3-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 1.3 Get to know your puppy. 

If you can't bring your puppies home right away, visit them regularly to let them adjust to new people. Many breeders will allow this, as it is an effective way to get your puppy to get used to.
- Of course, everything depends on where and who hand over the puppies. For example, if you adopt puppies from a stray dog ​​and cat hold, you need to bring them home immediately. However, if the puppies belong to the ideal breeder, you need to leave them with the mother for the time recommended by the breeder.

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-4]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-4-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 1.4 Buy widgets. 

Before you bring your puppy home, you need a lot of gear ready. Here is a list of essential items:
- Food and water bowls: The bowl should be made of stainless steel or porcelain, as this can be put in the dishwasher and easy to clean.
- The nest box should have a soft, cozy and comfortable material so that your puppy feels safe. Choose one that has a washable cover and consider buying two interchangeable bedding when one is laundered.
- Cleaning pads for puppies. These are absorbent and disposable when an unavoidable toilet training incident occurs.
- Disinfectants and household gloves. These two tools are used to clean up waste. Choose an enzyme cleaner and don't buy one that contains bleach or ammonia, as this can make the smell of the urine stronger and attract the puppy back to where it was.
- Housing: Choose a cage that is just the right size so that the puppy can get up and lie down all its legs. If the adult kennel is too large, you can fix the baffles to adjust the housing to the right size for the puppies. If the area is large, the puppy can go to the toilet in one place in the cage.
- Necklace and tag. Choose a nylon necklace and metal tag. The metal tag helps to identify the puppy if lost. You can start wearing collars when your puppies are at least 6 months old and change them as they get older.
- The harness and leash: You should get the puppy accustomed to the object as soon as possible so that it can be controlled while in the yard, not running away while you are training the puppy to use the toilet.
- Toys: The greyhound loves to nibble on furniture, so purchase a certified safe toy. Inspect toys regularly for damage and throw them away if necessary. Keep in mind that stuffed animals, a toy's eyes or nose, or even an inner cords can cause intestinal obstruction if swallowed. So you need to be very careful.
- Treats for puppies: Buy soft, crunchy foods. Crispy type helps remove tartar, while soft foods are used during training.
- Dog food. Buy the one they eat as much as possible.
- Basic cleaning tools: Prepare a brush, comb, rubber gloves, with nail clippers, dog shampoo and conditioner, toothpaste, brush, and towels.

## 2. Take your puppy home

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-5]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-5-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Take the puppies right to the pooch spot before you take them home. 

This will be the place to deal with their sadness. Bring the puppy closer to the toilet and see if they are excreting waste. If so, give your puppy lots of compliments and offer treats so they associate the place with the act of defecating. [3]
- Take the puppy for a walk around the garden and surrounding areas before entering the house. This helps them to familiarize themselves with the environment and define new territories. [4]

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-6-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Quietly bring the puppy inside. 

You should not fuss and show love for them. The puppies need time to adjust to the new home. Ask the children to sit still and allow the puppies to come in close so they don't feel too stressed out. Watch your puppy closely, and when you catch sniffing to find a way to deal with your sadness, immediately take him out of the toilet site, and reward him if he goes to the toilet. . [5]

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-7-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Put leashes on your puppies and take them for a walk around the house. 

After you bring your puppies home, you can introduce them to your new home. This will help the puppy feel more comfortable with the location of the furniture. You don't have to let your puppy get to know each room right away, you should just introduce some accessible room areas. [6]

## 3. Feed the puppies

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-8-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Ask the producer to provide past feed in sufficient quantity for 4-5 days. 

This helps the puppies absorb food that is familiar to their stomach. Change the type of food slowly, one to two days after the puppy is at home. [7]
- To change foods, you can add ¼ new foods and reduce old foods to. After 2-3 days, gradually increase the amount of new food until the puppy can eat the new food completely. This step helps your stomach get used to new foods to avoid diarrhea caused by sudden food changes.

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-9-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Choose foods labeled "Growth" or "Puppies" so that your dog can get the calcium and protein they need for growth. 

Check food labels and look for meat ingredients, such as chicken, beef, or lamb. Thus, the main ingredient is one of the above-mentioned meats that demonstrate feed quality. Avoid foods whose main ingredients are cereal flours and "byproducts," because they contain very few nutrients.
- After the puppies are 1 year old, you can switch to adult dog food.

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-10-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Feed the puppies on a fixed schedule. 

For puppies under 12 weeks of age, you should feed the recommended amount (according to the instructions on the package) divided into 4 servings per day. For puppies 3 to 6 months old, divide the food into 3 servings daily. When you reach the age of 6 months or more, feed 2 times a day.
- When the puppies are one year old, you can feed them once a day.

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-11-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Do not give your puppy lots of junk food or extra food. 

Remember that greyhounds are very gluttonous. They have no concept of fullness, so you should not feed them more when they see their begging expression. Also, the food should be out of reach and kept in a sealed container, as puppies love to break down the pantry. [8]
- However, greyhounds are often stimulated by food, so you can take advantage of this when training them.

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-12-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Take the puppy out after eating. 

It is important to note that after eating for about 10-20 minutes, the puppy will need to go to the toilet. Take them out after meals and be with the puppies to praise them if they handle their sadness in the right place.

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-13-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.6 Use warm water and dish soap to clean the puppy's food bowl. 

Or you can put it in the dishwasher. Cleaning the food bowls helps to prevent disease, bacteria from multiplying, and adds more appeal to meals.

## 4. Exercise for the puppies

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-14-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Give your puppy lots of gentle exercise. 

The greyhound is lively and needs a lot of running, but you need to watch out for the joints of the developing puppy. These joints are very susceptible to injury. To avoid an unfortunate accident, like when an athlete warm-up before a run, take the puppy for a walk for about 5 minutes before playing a game of tag or throwing. [9]

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-15-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 4.2 Do not allow the puppy to exercise excessively to interfere with the joints. 

The basic rule is that you need to stop when you see them having difficulty moving. Tired muscles will no longer be able to support joints. This is the time when the joint is most susceptible to injury. If your puppy is still bouncing and bouncing normally, you can rest easy.
- Avoid strenuous puppies until they reach adulthood, between 12-18 months.

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-16-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 4.3 Take the puppy for a short 5-minute walk each day. 

If they go for a longer walk, they may tire and suffer from joint pain. You can give your puppy some extra training with a thrashing game or a toy tug of war.
- Spend as much time as you can with your puppy. You won't waste too much time, so you can take advantage of this time to play and practice your puppy regularly.

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-17-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 4.4 Don't leave your puppy outside alone. 

The greyhound will not train on its own unless you join them. In addition, this breed loves to roam and explore. This means that if you do not monitor the puppies, they will try to get past the fence on their own to get out. They are masters in digging and climbing, so your fence will not be of any use. [ten]
- If your puppy is unable to get out, watch out for barking or howling in frustration. The best way to prevent this is to give them exercise that stimulates the brain a lot to be satisfied and not feel bored or annoyed.

## 5. Puppy training

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-18-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 5.1 Start training your puppies as soon as possible. 

This breed has a rather stubborn trait, so you need to conduct early training so that they will obey you. Incorporate the training into your routine, such as asking the puppy to sit down before feeding or leash. You should only train in short sessions, every 5-10 minutes, when the puppies are less than four months old.

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-19-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 5.2 Use bonus training. 

Do not punish your puppies, or they will associate the punishment with you (and become more reserved) rather than linked to their wrongdoing. Instead, reward the puppy for the correct behavior. Always love, care for, and guide your puppy in good behavior.

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-20-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 5.3 Train your puppy to do the basic command of submission. 

This helps the puppy get along with the owner for a long time. Start teaching your puppy to sit down. Then train them to come to you when called and stay on command. You can also train your puppies to defecate in the correct place as soon as you bring them home.

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-21]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-21-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 5.4 Carry the puppies in the car regularly so that they get used to walking with their owner. 

If not, every time you bring the puppy in the car, he or she will think that he is going to see the vet. Your puppy will then whine and annoy you.

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-22]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-22-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 5.5 Practice early acclimation for puppies. 

Take your puppies to management class once a week. This helps the puppy learn to respond to dogs and strangers.
- However, the puppies should not come into contact with other puppies without their full vaccination.

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-23]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-23-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 5.6 Teach your puppy to adapt to the barn. 

Puppies often feel safe in the crate and the crate will provide shelter. You can spread blankets on the bottom of the cage that smells like the mother, and hide treats in the cage so the puppies associate the crate with the good experience.
- Alternatively, you can feed the puppies in the barn. Initially you should feed when you open the door. After a while, close the door for a few seconds, open it, and praise the puppy for his good manners. Gradually close the door for longer until you can keep the puppies in the cage for up to four hours in a row, but they won't feel any discomfort. [11]
- Turn on the radio while you're away from home. This helps the puppy feel more secure.

## 6. Take care of your puppy's health

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-24]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-24.jpg.webp)

### 6.1 Get your puppies vaccinated. 

Schedule a visit to your veterinarian for vaccinations when they are 6-8 weeks old. Your veterinarian will advise on what local specific disease risks and which diseases need to be vaccinated.
- You should also discuss with your veterinarian about sterilization to make the best decision for your pet.

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-25]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-25.jpg.webp)

### 6.2 Take your puppy to the veterinarian at least every six months. 

You need to bring your dog to regular health checkups for early detection of disease if any. Puppy care includes preventive health care treatment, such as cardiovascular parasiticides, fleas and ticks.

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-26]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-26.jpg.webp)

### 6.3 Teach your puppy to understand that seeing the doctor is fun (or at least tolerable). 

Bring snacks with you so that you can feed them while you are in the clinic. If you take your puppies to the doctor from a young age, they will be more comfortable with this.

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-27]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-27.jpg.webp)

### 6.4 Consider getting microchips under the puppy's skin. 

This involves a quick injection of a microchip into the skin. Each microchip has its own identifier containing your information and proof of ownership. This is especially useful for greyhounds because if they get out and roam, they can be locked up and scanned for their owner and will contact you.

## 7. Sanitize the puppies

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-28]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-28.jpg.webp)

### 7.1 Groom your puppy every day. 

Use a bristle brush to remove any loose hair and help the coat become shiny. Also, prepare your puppy's toothbrush and toothpaste so that your dog will get used to brushing his teeth right away.

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-29]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-29.jpg.webp)

### 7.2 Bathe your puppies when they are dirty. 

You should adjust the water temperature should not be too hot, nor should you bathe your pet too often. Otherwise, the puppy's skin will dry out.
- Use a mild shampoo, such as a moisturizing oat shampoo. Do not use products intended for people who dry their skin because the pH of dog skin is different from that of humans.

![Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-30]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-greyhounds/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Beagle-Puppy-Step-30.jpg.webp)

### 7.3 Clean the puppy's eyes and ears. 

Clean eyes every day to prevent infections and blemishes. Even non-white-haired breeds can get flare and skin inflammation around the eyes. You should clean your ears twice a week to get rid of earlobes and odors.

> Warning
- Do not leave items indiscriminately around the house that the puppy can swallow, causing choking.
- Do not delay the puppy training. If the training is too late, it will cause a BIG problem. Should start as soon as possible!
- Do not buy puppies younger than eight weeks old, as this is not the right age to separate them from the mother.
