> Congratulations on choosing a new family member! But the problem is, "How do I take care of this puppy?" Remember that this article is intended only for people who are new to adopting, buying, or finding puppies that are at least 8 weeks old.

## 1. Take the puppy home

### 1.1 Make sure the dog is right for you. 

Is its coat appropriate for the climate in which you live? Is its size suitable for living in your home? Can you get your puppy to function properly with its energy levels? Thoughtful consideration of all of the above will ensure a happy life for your dog. It also affects the happiness of your family.

### 1.2 Make your home safe to keep your puppies. 

Puppies love to explore everything. For the safety of your dog and your home, you need to take some precautions.
- Remove any fragile objects from the area where you plan to keep the puppies.
- Leave all power cords overhead or cover, and close all low windows.
- Keep cleaning products / harmful chemicals carefully.
- Buy the trash as high as possible so your dog won't reach it and must be heavy so it won't be overthrown.
- Consider buying a folding gate or pens fence to keep your puppies in a certain area of ​​your home.

### 1.3 Make arrangements for the puppies. 

The kitchen or bathroom is ideal for a puppy's nest during the day, as these are usually warm and washable. At night, keep your puppy in a crib in your bedroom. This way you can hear him all night and know when your puppy needs to go out and "deal with the grief".

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-4]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-4-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.4 Buy two metal (stainless) bowls - one for food and one for drinking water.

A metal bowl is better than a glass bowl because it doesn't chip and is cleaner. If you have other pets, be sure to give each child a separate bowl of food and water to avoid conflicts. When it is time to eat, you must separate them to avoid food scramble and to make sure each child gets enough nutrition.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-5]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-5-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.5 Prepare your puppy's bed. 

You can use a pillowcase, pillowcase, or a rattan basket lined with towels. Whatever you choose, make sure your puppy's bed is soft, comfortable, and dry. Have a blanket ready in case it's cold. To avoid conflicts, give each pet a separate bed.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-6-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.6 Give your puppy lots of toys. 

Your puppy is like an endless ball of energy, so be sure to give him lots of toys, both soft and chewy. Puppies' toys should be tough enough to prevent them from choking. Do not let your puppy play with food made from dried animal skin, only use it as a treat.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-7-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.7 Choose the right treatment as your puppy's treat. 

The puppy reward should be healthy, small, easy to chew, or swallow. The purpose of the reward is to quickly convey to your puppy that he has done a good job, but you probably don't want to wait until your puppy finishes eating before continuing with the training.
- Try out the "Bil Jac", "Zuke's Mini Natural" and "Greenies" rewards.
- Be sure to choose a variety: crispy and soft. Soft for training, crispy for cleaning dog teeth.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-8-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.8 Buy high-quality dog ​​food. 

Pellets, canned foods, homemade foods, and fresh foods are all good but talk to your veterinarian about each. When you first bring your puppy home, ask the seller or animal relief team about the food he is eating. You can continue to feed your puppy on the same pattern when you take it home. If you want to change, wait a few weeks, and gradually switch to a new diet over the course of a week. Sudden dietary changes may cause your dog to vomit or have diarrhea.
- Buy puppy food that contains no coloring, no artificial flavors or preservatives, as many dogs are allergic to these additives.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-9-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.9 Buy basic care equipment. 

Every dog ​​owner must have at least a brush, comb, rubber glove, nail clippers, dog bath oil, dog hair conditioner, dog toothpaste, and towels. Grooming is not only to beautify your dog but also to keep them healthy and happy.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-10-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.10 Buy nylon straps, necklaces (of either umbrella or leather), and name tags. 

The improper collar can hurt your puppy's neck and throat. Remember to measure the belt and collar size as your puppy gets older.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-11-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.11 Make your puppy comfortable in your home. 

Your puppy may be scared the first time you get to know a new home. You need to cuddle and care more about it in the first few days. Lightly tie up and guide your puppy to explore indoor and outdoor areas. You don't have to introduce everything to your dog on the first day, but showing him frequently visited areas is a good start.
- Do not let the puppies roam freely as problems will occur.
- Let your puppy sleep in a crib in your room at night so it doesn't feel alone or alone.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-12-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.12 Regularly petting your puppy. 

You need to stroke your pet's body, feet, and head several times a day. This move not only makes it feel loved but also creates a strong bond between you and your puppy. 

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-13-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.13 Handle the puppy carefully. 

Puppies are just as weak as babies. Gently hold the puppy in your arms if you want to lift it. Always put one hand under the puppy's chest.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-14-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.14 Protect your puppy. 

Puppies have a curious nature, and no matter how much attention they pay attention, they sometimes come out of the yard and go out of shape. Make sure your puppy wears a comfortable, adjustable collar and tag with your contact info. Wear tags should include your dog's name, address, and phone number.
- Many places require a dog certificate. It is a good idea to get a certificate for your puppy even if you don't ask for it.
- Your dog must be vaccinated against rabies for confirmation.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-15-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.15 Attach a chip to the puppy. 

The chip is very small - the size of a grain of rice - and is implanted under the skin, on the nape, and on the shoulders. You can register chip information in your contact information section when your veterinarian has a dog chip attached. In the unlikely event, your dog gets lost, your vet or animal welfare can also scan the chip and call you to help reunite with your puppy.
- Even though puppies already have collars and tags, experts still recommend fixing chips to every pet.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-16-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.16 Give your puppy a safe playground. 

A fenced-in yard is ideal. Experiment with a few things to see which toy your puppy likes best. If you are indoors, you can use a fence to give your puppies a private “playground”.

## 2. Feed the puppies

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-17-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Choose the right food for your puppy. 

Although you may be tempted to be cheap, it may not be the best option for your puppy. Look for foods that incorporate high-quality protein from fish, chicken, sheep, beef, and/or eggs. Talk to your veterinarian about dog food options. If you are going to change your puppy's diet, do it gradually to reduce the risk of her upset stomach.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-18-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Puppies eat properly. 

Feed your puppy several small meals throughout the day using puppy food. The amount of food per meal depends on the breed and size; Find the recommended amount of food for the breed you are keeping. Only feed your puppy the minimum recommended amount for the breed, its age, and size. Increase the amount of food if you find the puppy seems too thin, or as directed by your veterinarian. The number of feedings per day depends on the puppy's age:
- 6-12 weeks: 3 to 4 times per day
- 12-20 weeks: 3 times per day
- Over 20 weeks: 2 times a day

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-19-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Follow special feeding instructions for puppies and pet dogs. 

Very small breeds (Yorkshire Terriers, Pomeranians, Chihuahuas, etc.) can be susceptible to hypoglycemia. Usually, these puppies need to eat all day (or every 2-3 hours) until they are 6 months old. This prevents their blood sugar from dropping too low, leading to weakness, confusion, and even seizures.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-20-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 Avoid "buffet". 

Feeding your dog will help train your dog to use the toilet in the right place and prevent your dog from overeating. Furthermore, your puppy will bond with you by relating his favorite things like food to the rest of the house. Limit the amount of time you eat your puppy's meal to about 20 minutes.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-21]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-21.jpg.webp)

### 2.5 Watch your puppy eat. 

Viewing a puppy eating is a good way to gauge its health. If your puppy suddenly doesn't seem to want to eat, be careful. That behavior may simply be due to a lack of appetite, but it can also be a health problem.
- Your job is to notice any changes in your dog's behavior. Call your veterinarian, and take the appropriate steps to find the cause of the change.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-22]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-22-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.6 Do not give your dog pieces of human food. While eating and feeding your dog may sound tempting, but keep in mind that human food can make your dog obese. Aside from the health risks, such feeding can get your dog used to begging - one of the most difficult habits to break.

To ensure the health of your puppy, give him special dog food.
- You should completely ignore the dog while you are eating.
- Check with your vet about human foods that are safe for dogs. These dishes may include fried chicken breast or pea pods.
- Greasy foods can cause problems like pancreatitis in dogs.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-23]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-23-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.7 Protect your dog from food poisoning.

A dog's body is very different from a human. Some foods you can digest are toxic to dogs. Some of these foods can be mentioned:
- Grapefruit
- Raisins
- Tea
- Alcohol
- Garlic
- Onions
- Avocado
- Salt
- Chocolate
- If your dog has ingested one of the above, call the Animal Poison Center (888) 426-4435 (if in the US) and a veterinarian.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-24]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-24-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.8 Provide enough clean water. 

Unlike food, you should always keep a full bowl of clean water for your dog. Note that your dog will need to pee after drinking lots of fluids. Take the dog to the backyard so it won't cause a problem in your home.

## 3. Keep the puppies healthy

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-25]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-25.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Maintain a safe environment for your puppy. 

A dirty and unsafe environment can damage your dog's general health and cost your vet's bills.
- Wash dirty bedding right away. Teach your puppy to go to the bathroom in the right place, and change your dog's bed if you feel dirty with urine or droppings.
- Get rid of poisonous plants. There are many common plants that are toxic to puppies because they love to chew. Keep the puppy away from plants such as oleander, oleander, azaleas, yew, capillary, rhubarb, and clover.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-26]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-26.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Make sure your puppy gets plenty of exercises. Each breed needs a different amount of exercise. (This is a factor to consider when choosing a puppy). Take your puppy for a walk in the yard or garden after meals to explore and exercise. Start spending your dog going out for a walk if your veterinarian says it's safe. It is normal for puppies to release energy after a long sleep.

Even though your puppy's body is still growing, you should avoid rough play and heavy exercise. Wait until your puppy is 9 months old to start running (about 1.5 km).
- Give the puppy about an hour of walking every day, divided into 2 - 4 times. Allow your dog to interact with other (friendly) dogs he meets. (Only if your puppy has been fully vaccinated.)

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-27]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-27.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Get the puppy in contact. 

The period of external contact for puppies is 7-16 weeks old. It is very important to consider giving your puppy a "beginner" class to get him acquainted with other dogs before this period passes. In the "beginner classes", puppies are safely played under the supervision and vaccinated. Most puppies complete Distemper / Parvo vaccinations before 16 weeks of age.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-28]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-28.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Choose a vet if you haven't already. 

Ask a friend to introduce some of the doctors. When you have a few options, you should try a few clinics to see which one you like best. Choose a clinic that is friendly, well organized, and odor-free. Ask questions with doctors and staff - they'll always answer to the best of their ability. Make sure you are comfortable with the veterinarian of your choice.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-29]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-29.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Vaccination for puppies. 

When your puppies are 6-9 weeks old, take your dog to the vet to begin vaccinating the dog. Talk to your doctor about distemper, parainfluenza, canine hepatitis, and parvovirus. Your doctor may recommend additional vaccines, depending on your dog's risk level and the area in which you live.
- Be sure to talk to your doctor about deworming the first time you bring your puppies. Your veterinarian may recommend periodic cleaning of parasites like roundworms right away. Or your doctor may take a dog stool sample to identify the parasite before prescribing a medication.
- Deworming for puppies is not only good for your dog's health, but it's also good for your health. Many dog ​​parasites can infect humans and cause health problems for your whole family.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-30]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-30.jpg.webp)

### 3.6 Going back for rabies vaccination.

After the first visit, you need to bring your dog back to the clinic for rabies vaccination when the puppies are 12-16 weeks old. Ask your veterinarian about rabies vaccination (and legal) recommendations in your area.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-31]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-31.jpg.webp)

### 3.7 Sterilize for dogs. 

Talk to your doctor about the timing of the surgery. Doctors often recommend waiting after the vaccination is finished, but other considerations may be available.
- For example, the sterilization procedure in larger breeds is more complicated and expensive. Your doctor may recommend sterilization before your dog reaches 22 or 27 kg if your breed is particularly large.
- Sterilize a bitch before her first estrous. This will reduce the risk of pyelonephritis, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer. 

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-32]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-32.jpg.webp)

### 3.8 Make the trip to the clinic fun. 

Bring treats and toys with you to the doctor to teach your dog to enjoy (or at least tolerate) the experience. Before taking your puppy to the doctor for the first time, you should get it used to the touch of the legs, tail, and face. This way, your puppy will not be unfamiliar to the doctor.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-33]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-33.jpg.webp)

### 3.9 Be mindful of your puppy's health concerns. 

Watch your puppy for early symptoms, if any. The dog's eyes should be bright, and his nose and eyes must not discharge. The dog's coat must be clean and shiny; Pay attention if the dog's coat is tangled or sparse. Check for lumps, inflammation, or skin rash, as well as signs of diarrhea around the tail area.

## 4. Groom your puppy

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-34]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-34.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Groom your dog every day. 

Brushing keeps your puppy clean and healthy, and you can check for skin or coat problems. Grooming combs and cleaning tools vary from dog to dog. Consult your veterinarian, dog caregiver, or breeder for more information.
- Brush all the dog's fur, including the belly and hind legs.
- Start when your puppy is young so it won't be afraid of brushing.
- Start slowly, remembering to use rewards and toys. Only brush for a few minutes at a time to keep your puppy from getting overwhelmed.
- Do not brush the dog's face and feet with tools that could cause pain.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-35]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-35.jpg.webp)

### 4.2 Trim your puppy's nails.

Ask your veterinarian or dog caregiver to teach you dog clipping techniques. Improper nail clipping can hurt your dog if you cut the flesh under the nail. This is especially important if your puppy has black nails that make it difficult to identify the flesh under the claw.
- A dog's paw that is too long can cause strain on the ankle, and damage floors and furniture, and possibly injure people.
- Cut the puppies weekly, unless otherwise directed by your doctor.
- Use good food as a reward and praise your dog. Cut it off at a time to keep your puppy from getting scared.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-36]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-36.jpg.webp)

### 4.3 Keep your puppy's gums clean. 

Chewing toys help keep puppies healthy. Special toothbrushes and toothpaste for dogs are helpful for keeping the dog's teeth clean and healthy. Slowly get your dog used to brushing his teeth so that this becomes a positive experience with your puppy. Don't forget to show your dog the reward and praise it!

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-37]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-37.jpg.webp)

### 4.4 Bathe your puppy only when needed. 

Bathing more than necessary can dry out your dog's skin and remove important oils from his coat. Slowly familiarize your dog with the water and bathing procedures. As always, reward your dog and praise it.

## 5. Puppy training

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-38]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-38.jpg.webp)

### 5.1 Practice the dog to use the toilet in the right place. 

Start with this the first day you bring the puppies home. The longer you linger, the more you have to clean for it, and the harder it will be for your dog to teach. Consider using a litter training pad for the first few days. While this doesn't replace taking your dog to the backyard, it does help in the transition period. You should also consider this vehicle if your home does not have a backyard.
- Keep your dog in a newspaper fence or toilet training pad when you cannot watch.
- Do not let puppies go around indoors. If you are not playing with your dog, place it in a crate or pens, or tie it to a seating area.
- Watch for signs that the puppy wants to poop and take the dog outside right away. Always put your dog in the same place.
- Praise (and reward) your dog as soon as he knows how to go to the bathroom!

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-39]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-39.jpg.webp)

### 5.2 Consider training your puppy to stay in the crate. 

There are many benefits to training your puppy to stay in a crate. First, it limits destructive behavior, allows you to sleep, and leaves your dog alone without a worry. Second, it is an effective method of toilet training (if used correctly).

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-40]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-40.jpg.webp)

### 5.3 Teach your dog basic commands. 

A good dog is a joy in the home. Teaching your puppy good early habits is a good place to start. This way you and your puppy will have a good relationship. Teaching your dog good habits in the first place is always easier than giving up bad habits.
- Teach your dog to get close.
- Teach your dog to sit.
- Teach your dog to lie down.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-41]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-41.jpg.webp)

### 5.4 Introduce the puppy to the ride. 

Put your puppy in the car as often as she can get used to moving with you. If not, the puppy may be afraid to ride. If your puppy has motion sickness, talk to your veterinarian about anti-nausea medication. This will make the ride more pleasant for you and your dog.

![Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-42]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-raise-puppies/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-Puppies-Step-42.jpg.webp)

### 5.5 Sign up for a puppy obedience class.

This will of course help you to better train your dog. Also, this is an opportunity for contact, helping the puppy learn to behave in the presence of other dogs and unfamiliar people.

> Advice
- Be careful with young children and make sure everyone knows the puppy's rules (eg how to hold a dog, not rude, etc.)
- Make sure your puppy is well-rested (at least 6 -10 hours).
- Give your puppies plenty of affection, positive attention, and gentle (but determined) good behavior.
- If you buy a puppy for a baby, you must be willing to take care of it yourself, as young children often get bored quickly.
- Wash your dog's food dishes every day with warm water and dish soap. Or just put it in the dishwasher. Washing dishes can prevent disease and bacteria from growing, making each meal more enjoyable.
- Instead of trying to brush your dog's teeth, you can let him chew his ears or something like that. The dog's teeth will be shaved when chewing these foods.
- Be careful, as other dogs or other animals can attack and/or kill your puppy. It is your responsibility to take care of it. If your dog is out, try to tie the leash to the dog's neck. Puppies are easy to get lost, and it can be difficult to find them because they are too young.
- Chips should be attached to dogs. This way you will have more chances to find it quickly if your puppy gets lost.
- Name your puppy often. Puppies will soon know its name.
- Make sure to spend a lot of time with your dog.
- Puppies are mischievous, and they need a lot of exercises, but remember that they also need a break!

> Warning
- This site shows only how to care for puppies that are at least 8 weeks old. You should not buy or adopt puppies that are younger than 8 weeks because they are too young to move into a new home. In some US states, this is included in the law.
- Do not let puppies come into contact with unfamiliar dogs if they are not fully vaccinated. Communicate with friendly, vaccinated, and non-contaminated dogs with your dog.
