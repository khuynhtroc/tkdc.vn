## 1. Cure stomach pain for dogs

### 1.1 Stop feeding the dog. 

If your dog has a digestive problem, let his or her stomach rest. When you feed your dog, his stomach and intestines are forced to produce digestive juices to process the food. Gastrointestinal fluids will worsen inflammation or pain, and illnesses will therefore get worse.
- Stop feeding the dog for 24 hours.
- If you still experience symptoms of abdominal pain, you should see your veterinarian.

### 1.2 Give your dog cool, clean water. 

Watch your dog drink water. Within 24 hours, if your dog is drinking less than usual and still seems uncomfortable, see your vet. You should also be aware if your dog is thirsty often. Some dogs will tend to drink a lot of water when sick. Your dog will vomit if he drinks a full bowl of water at once.
- If your dog vomits water, divide the water into small s and give it to the dog every 30 minutes.
- If your dog weighs less than 10 kg, give him half a c## p. of water every 30 minutes (egg cup). If your dog weighs more than 10 kg, give him about half a cup of water (the size of a cup of tea) every 30 minutes. If your dog stops vomiting after 2-3 hours, you can give him plenty of fluids as usual.
- Take your dog to the vet if he continues to vomit even if you limit the amount of water you drink.

### 1.3 Slowly re-feed the dog as usual. 

If after 24 hours, your dog seems to have recovered and wants to eat, give him a bland food for the next 24 hours. Feed your dog low-fat and easy-to-digest foods like chicken breast, rabbit meat, turkey, or cod. You can combine meat with white pasta, rice or mashed boiled potatoes (don't feed your dog dairy products).
- Do not feed your dog any 'chicken flavored' foods. This food contains little chicken and is not a substitute for real chicken. [first]
- Check with your veterinarian about what foods to feed your dog to help him recover. Your doctor may recommend Hills ID or Purina EN.

### 1.4 Initially, the dog should eat less. 

To probe the dog's stomach, the first meal after a 24-hour fast should be only 1/4 of the normal amount of food. Eating less will help your dog's digestive system feel better. This will make it easier for you to check on your dog's recovery.
- If after 24 hours of fasting and your dog still refuses to eat or eats little, you should seek medical attention.

### 1.5 Pet the dog. 

Every time you get sick, caring and loving gestures will help the patient recover quickly. Therefore, sit with your dog and talk to him in a gentle and reassuring voice. Rub the dog's head and caress it along the spine.
- Do not massage your dog's stomach. Your dog cannot tell you if you are helping him or her getting worse or worse. If you hit on a icularly sensitive spot, you will cause the dog to suddenly sting and turn to bite you.

### 1.6 Keep your dog warm. 

Some dogs feel better with heat therapy. If your dog is shivering, you can use a hot water bottle wrapped in a towel to roll over the dog's body. Make sure that if it feels uncomfortable (eg overheating), the dog can avoid itself. Do not force it and let them know if they want to continue to take heat therapy.

### 1.7 Contact your veterinarian when needed. 

If your dog is just a little uncomfortable and still healthy, just watch and follow the steps above to make him more comfortable. However, you should contact your veterinarian if your dog is experiencing any of the following disturbing signs:
- Vomiting is not possible. Trying to vomit but not being able to vomit indicates a twisted stomach. Contact a veterinarian immediately in case of emergency
- Vomiting for more than 4 hours continuously
- Vomiting and not keeping water in the stomach. This indicates that the dog is at risk of dehydration. You will need to contact your veterinarian to give your dog an infusion if necessary.
- Sluggishness and lack of energy
- Do not eat for more than 24 hours
- Diarrhea (without blood) for more than 24 hours
- Diarrhea that is bloody
- Increased discomfort level, such as whining

### 1.8 Give your dog a medication to treat vomiting. 

If your dog has frequent upset stomachs for a reason (such as from chemotherapy or kidney disease), your veterinarian may prescribe medication.
- Maropitant (Cerenia) is a commonly prescribed medication for dogs that have undergone chemotherapy. [2] Give your dog a drink once a day. The drug works within 24 hours. The oral dose is 2 mg / kg of the dog's weight. For example, an average heavy Labrador will need to take 60 mg of the drug once per day.

## 2. Diagnose your dog's colic

### 2.1 Be wary if the dog appears restless. 

As a pet dog, you will know what is wrong with him. Whether the dog is normally active or enjoys lying down, you can immediately notice if the dog is more agitated than usual. This could be a sign of an upset stomach.
- The dog cannot find a comfortable position to lie down.
- Your dog may be able to step back and forth continuously.

### 2.2 Note if the dog keeps looking at one side. 

The flanks of the dog are located near the legs and just in front of the thighs. Sometimes when he gets sick, the dog doesn't understand what's going on with it. This time, the dog will often turn its neck around to look for the cause of the discomfort and pain. The dog turns his head to look at the flanks that may be abdominal pain.

### 2.3 Excessive licking. 

Abdominal pain or cramps often makes your dog feel nauseous. When a dog has stomach pain and nausea, he tends to lick his lips repeatedly. Some dogs even lick their front legs or other s of their body to try to make themselves more comfortable.
- Unusual or excessive drooling can also be a sign of nausea or upset stomach. However, some dog breeds are naturally drooling, so be sure to understand your dog to know if drooling is a sign of abnormality##  .Dry ingestion can also be caused by an upset stomach.

### 2.4 Hear gurgling or yelling in the dog's stomach. 

If your dog has colic due to a digestive disorder, you may hear an unusual sound coming from the dog's stomach. This sound is caused by air moving through the intestines and causing the dog's stomach to gasp.
- Not hearing sounds from your stomach doesn't mean your dog doesn't have a stomach ache, but it might be because you can't hear it.

### 2.5 Pay attention if the dog is in the "kneeling" position. 

The 'kneeling position' is the primary sign when your dog has colic. This pose is very similar to kneeling when the dog is playing. You can tell if your dog is kneeling or in pain based on his attitude.
- The dog will lift his buttocks high and stretch his forelegs on the ground.
- In this position, the dog is trying to stretch its stomach to ease the discomfort.

### 2.6 Watch for vomiting and diarrhea. 

You will be more likely to notice if your dog has vomiting or diarrhea. Like humans, dogs suffer from vomiting and diarrhea when they have an upset stomach. While cleaning up is not fun, don't get angry with your dog because he cannot control it on his own.

## 3. Prevent stomach upset for dogs

### 3.1 Do not let your dog eat spoiled food. 

Dogs usually eat almost everything. Unfortunately, the food the dog eats includes spoiled food, which can cause stomach upset or more serious problems. Make sure to dispose of spoiled food in a safe place so that your dog cannot rummage through and eat. Sweep the yard regularly to remove pests or dead animals. Remember, dogs can smell rotten meat faster than you can.

### 3.2 Do not overfeed your dog. 

Many people like to feed their dogs freely as much as they want. They find it easier to freely feed dogs than to eat the right meals. However, experts advise against doing so. Feeding the dog a lot and comfortably will make the dog more likely to become obese, along with related health problems. Overeating in a short period of time can also lead to abdominal pain, which can be prevented with a little effort.
- For adult dogs, you should feed them twice a day - once in the morning and once in the evening. The amount of food per meal depends on the size of the breed. The amount of dog food on food packaging often varies, so consult your veterinarian for more specific instructions.
- You can use an online tool to calculate recommended calories for dogs. [5] After doing some research, you can look at the calories on the food and feed your dog the recommended amount.

### 3.3 Buy high quality food. 

There are food products for specific types of dogs on the market. However, dog food is not dependent on the breed. Instead, keep an eye on your dog's "size" and choose recipes that will boost your metabolism.
- Choose foods with high quality ingredients. Cheap foods often contain poor quality ingredients and are indigestible.
- Just like human food, dog food must also indicate the content of the ingredients on the packaging. Choose protein-rich foods like fish, meat, or eggs. The more protein a food has, the easier it is for the dog to digest.

### 3.4 Do not feed your dog the foods listed below. 

Although dogs can eat almost any food, unlike humans, they cannot digest all of them. Many of the foods we eat every day can be toxic to dogs. An upset stomach in dogs when eating these in small amounts can cause poisoning. Absolutely do not give your dog the following foods: [7] :
- Avocado
- Bread flour
- Chocolate
- Wine
- Grapes or raisins
- Food containing hops
- Macadamia seeds
- Onion
- Garlic
- Xylitol, the product commonly found in "sugar-free" foods.

### 3.5 Do not let your dog play with sick dogs. 

Just like infecting children with flu, dogs can become infected by contact with other sick dogs. If you know that a dog is sick, avoid contact with your dog to prevent infection.
- The dog park is a difficult place to count the number of dogs because there are so many dogs playing here. In addition to this, every day other dogs come to the park to play.
- If your dog is sick, check with the dog owners around if any dogs have been sick recently.
- See the owner of the infected dog to find out what your dog is sick with and how serious it is.

### 3.6 Identify potential health problems that may be causing your dog stomach pain. 

Some illnesses, for example pancreatitis, cause frequent abdominal pain. If you know your dog has a similar condition, watch closely for signs of stomach pain and other symptoms regularly. Watch if your dog becomes slow, sick, or has diarrhea. Take your dog to the vet early to help ease the pain and recover faster.
- Be careful with some illnesses (like diabetes) as these can get worse if the dog can't eat. Simple abdominal pain can irritate and worsen the condition as well. Contact your veterinarian if your dog has any changes in his eating habits.
