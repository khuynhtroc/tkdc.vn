> Nail trimming is an important part of keeping your dog's pedicure neat and clean. This also helps to keep floors and furniture free from scratches. Long toenails can easily break, cause bleeding or can grow back into the foot and cause pain. Too long toenails can also make it difficult to move the dog. The nail trimming will help prevent these problems, by the way you can check for any irregularities (if any) on your dog's paw.

## 1. Get your dog used to being held

### 1.1 Choose the right time. 

Most dogs don't like to have their toenails trimmed, so choose a time when they are relaxing. If the dog is playing, wait until it lies down, then approach it to train it to get used to being held.

### 1.2 Keep the dog's feet gently. 

Start by slowly touching its legs. If the dog is unresponsive, give it a gentle massage and press on its toenails. Depending on your dog's age and personality, it may take a few tries before he gets used to it. Repeat the exercise several times a day until the dog is no longer responding to being held on.

### 1.3 Teach your dog to lie on his side when pruning his nails if necessary. 

If your dog has had a bad impression of nail pruning, he probably won't let you do it. For example, if the dog has been cut off by someone in the "pink" area (which contains many nerves and blood vessels in the toenail), it will suffer pain and heavy bleeding. Older dogs may experience arthritis in their toes and nail pruning makes them uncomfortable. In these cases, it is easier to lie down when you trim your nails.
- Let your dog lie on his side when you train him in handshake exercises to trim his nails.
- You can also trim the claws while the dog is standing without lifting the paw. Use this method only if you are more experienced in nail cutting. [first]

### 1.4 Check for foot abnormalities. [2] 

When you are massaging your feet and toenails, take the opportunity to check on your dog's health. Take it to your vet if you experience any pain, sores, broken nails, swelling or redness, lame legs or weirdly colored nails before trying to prune them. [3] Injuries, infections, tumors, and autoimmune diseases are common symptoms in dogs.
- Injuries usually only occur on one toe and are caused by running and jumping on rough surfaces or nails that are not properly trimmed.
- An injury or illness such as diabetes or hypothyroidism can lead to nail infection. Bacterial infections often cause pain, swelling and decreased immune systems around the toenails.
- Fungal and parasitic infections are less common than bacterial infections, but have similar symptoms.
- Tumors can take many different shapes: lumps, lumps, swelling, redness, or pus.
- Immune diseases can also affect toenails, making them brittle and prone to flaking.
- Report these symptoms to your veterinarian as soon as possible so that your dog can be treated.

### 2.1 Use dog-specific nail clippers. 

Human nail clippers are designed for a flat surface, but dog paws are different. Using human nail clippers can cause the nail to bruise, causing pain or injury to your dog. There are different types of dog claw trimming, but the most common is a straight cut (U-shaped) or a "scissors" cut. Choosing which method to cut depends on the cutter.
- The "scissors" cut is usually easier to apply, since you do not have to press the surface of the forceps against the nail.

### 2.2 Locate the pink area. 

The pink area is a part of the toenail that contains many blood vessels and nerves. Cutting into this area will cause pain and bleeding. Ideally, you should only trim your nails 2 to 4 mm away from the pink area.
- If your dog has white claws, you should easily see the pink inside the toenail.
- If the dog has dark claws, this area is hard to see. Carefully prune little by little to avoid trimming it. You can ask your dog care worker or veterinarian to show you how long you should be to cut.
- If your dog's claws grow too long, the pink area will develop. Regular nail trimming will return the pink area to its original length.

### 2.3 Keep the dog still. 

If your dog is used to being restrained, just lay it down and prune its claws. If your dog is constantly moving, gently use the elbows and arms that are holding the dog's paws to keep it lying down.
- If you have an extremely active dog, ask someone for help. Ask a friend to hold the dog so you can focus on trimming the claws.

### 2.4 Start with the hind legs. 

The hind nails are usually shorter and easier to trim. Dogs tend to be more tolerant of having hind legs than foregrounds, so start with your hind legs and continue with your front legs.
- Locate and approximate the location of the pink area before cutting deeper into the nail.
- Be careful when pruning near the pink area and stop when 2-3 mm from the pink area.
- Don't forget to trim your nails if you have one. Some dogs will have claws on the inside of their legs, above the "pastern." [4]

### 2.5 Stop bleeding if you cut the pink area. 

Cutting off the pink area often causes a lot of bleeding, the dog may yell for pain or bite you back in defense. If your hand bleeds, cover your toenails with a tissue and hold for a few minutes. If the bleeding still doesn't stop, use cornstarch or hemostatic powder. You can dip the dog's feet in the powder or use your hand to apply a large amount of powder to the wound.
- If the bleeding doesn't stop after 10 minutes, call your veterinarian.

### 2.6 Praise your dog often. 

Give your dog lots of encouragement, and if possible, a little food can be a great incentive to stay still. Praise your dog for every pedicure and enjoy his food every time he has one paw trimmed.

### 2.7 File your nails if you want. 

Dog nails, like human nails, are also very rough when they first cut. It will wear off on its own, but if you are unsure about the floor and indoor furniture, file your dog's nails as soon as you are trimmed to make them less sharp.

> Advice
- Praise your dog a lot so they know they are doing a good job.
- Bathe your dog first so that the soft nails will help you trim it easier.

> Warning
- DO NOT cut into a blood vessel inside the toenail!
- Cutting the pink area without cleaning the cut can lead to infection.
- Always wash and disinfect nail clippers after use to avoid risk of infection.
- Ingrown nails should be examined by a veterinarian; you shouldn't cut yourself.
- If you notice that your dog is limping after a nail trimmed, consult your veterinarian.
