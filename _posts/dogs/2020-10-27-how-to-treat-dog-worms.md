> There are 5 basic types of worms that dogs often get: filariasis and 4 types of intestinal parasitic worms, which are roundworm, tapeworm, hookworm and whipworm. Your veterinarian will know which worms are common in your area, and how to test and treat them. Dogs need specialized anthelmintic drugs and therapies, as many types of worms can kill dogs. The following article will guide you to recognize and treat 5 types of worms, although the initial symptoms are often difficult to detect and only manifest when the dog is heavily infected or for a long time.

## 1. Know the signs of a worm infection

### 1.1 Understanding of intestinal parasitic worms. 

Roundworms, tapeworms, hookworms, and whipworms are commonly found in the intestinal tract of dogs and in the feces of infected animals. These worms often cause some common symptoms that you can identify in some cases. [1]
- Some intestinal helminths can be passed from dog to dog through "stool-to-mouth". The worm eggs in the feces of an infected dog can be passed to another dog's mouth and intestinal tract. Even if you cannot see the eggs or feces, the dog will accidentally become infected with worm eggs that exist in the grass. Dogs that eat worm eggs when licking their feet will become infected with helminths in the intestinal tract. [2]
- The main route of infection with tapeworms is when dogs accidentally eat fleas. [3]
- While it is not possible to determine the type of worms your dog is infected with, you can monitor your symptoms to see if your dog needs treatment for intestinal worms.

### 1.2 Check the dog's feces. 

Intestinal helminths can be detected by observing abnormal changes in the dog's stool. You should look for signs like:
- Roundworms and whipworms can both cause diarrhea. If your dog has frequent and persistent diarrhea, seek medical attention immediately. [4]
- Hookworms and whipworms can both cause a dog to bleed. If you see blood in your dog's feces, contact your veterinarian immediately. [5]
- The tapeworm fragments often appear in dog feces or cling to the hair around the dog's anus. If you notice an object that looks like a white rice seed mixed in your feces, your dog is most likely infected with tapeworms. [6]

### 1.3 Watch for signs of vomiting. 

Dogs infected with intestinal helminths, especially roundworms and tapeworms, may vomit frequently. [7]

### 1.4 Pay attention when your dog coughs. 

In some cases, dogs infected with helminths, especially roundworms, may have a cough. [8]
- A cough can be a sign of many other medical conditions, so see your veterinarian right away.

![Treat-Worms-in-Dogs-Step-5]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-treat-dog-worms/v4-728px-Treat-Worms-in-Dogs-Step-5-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.5 Track your physical changes. 

Your dog can become infected with intestinal helminths if the middle part of the body suddenly grows larger or the dog loses weight quickly. [9]
- An enlarged abdomen can be a sign of ringworm, while weight loss can be a symptom of roundworm, tapeworm or whipworm.

![Treat-Worms-in-Dogs-Step-6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-treat-dog-worms/v4-728px-Treat-Worms-in-Dogs-Step-6-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.6 Pay attention to the dog's fur and skin. 

Certain types of intestinal helminths can be detected based on their effect on the brightness of the coat color or skin condition. [ten]
- If the shiny coat becomes droopy and dull, the dog is most likely infected with roundworm.
- Skin irritation may be a sign of hookworm.

### 1.7 Be wary if your dog has frequent gas. 

If the dog is more full than usual ("farting" repeatedly), the dog may have been infected with worms, especially whipworms. [11]

![Treat-Worms-in-Dogs-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-treat-dog-worms/v4-728px-Treat-Worms-in-Dogs-Step-8-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.8 Watch for signs of anemia. 

Worms can eat up all of your dog's important nutrients, which in turn can cause your dog to become iron deficient. [twelfth]
- You can detect anemia by observing your dog's gums. Like humans, dog's gums are also pink in color. The pale gums indicate that the dog may be anemic due to hookworm and whipworm infection.

### 1.9 Watch your dog's behavior. 

Dogs can change their behavior a lot if infected with helminths. For example:
- A dog infected with a tapeworm may become agitated, have stomach pain, or itch around the anus, so the dog can drag his butt on the ground. [13]
- Dogs infected with hookworms or whipworms can become fussy. Sudden loss of energy can be a warning sign of the need to see the vet. [14]

![Treat-Worms-in-Dogs-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-treat-dog-worms/v4-728px-Treat-Worms-in-Dogs-Step-10-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.10 You should have your dog examined for worms periodically. 

Worms can only parasitize in the blood and are transmitted by mosquito bites. [15] Unlike the four types of worms above, early stage filariasis usually show no symptoms and dogs can function normally for many years without showing any external signs. [16] Therefore, you need to regularly take your dog for blood tests to detect filariasis.
- In most areas, an annual blood test is sufficient to detect latent worms, as well as to make sure the only worms prevention medications are harmful to the health of the dog. [17]
- When a dog is heavily infected with filariasis, a dog may present with symptoms such as swelling of the abdomen, dull hair color, cough, rapid breathing, and difficulty or weakness. [18]
- Often it is too late if the dog exhibits any of the above symptoms, as severe cases can lead to death. Therefore, taking your dog to the vet regularly is extremely important job. [19]

## 2. Treatment of helminths

### 2.1 Stool test. 

If you suspect that your dog is infected with intestinal helminths, you should contact your veterinarian immediately to make an accurate diagnosis and prescribe an appropriate treatment for your dog. [20]
- Your vet may ask you to collect and bring a sample of dog feces for examination. Your veterinarian will use a stool sample to diagnose and determine the type of worms your dog is infected with.

![Treat-Worms-in-Dogs-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-treat-dog-worms/v4-728px-Treat-Worms-in-Dogs-Step-12-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Use medication. 

Most cases of intestinal helminthiasis in dogs can be treated with one of several different oral medications. The type of medication and how often it is taken depends on the veterinarian's recommendation and the type of dog worm that is infected.
- For roundworms and hookworms, you need to give your dog a "deworming" medication and during a certain period of treatment, the dog should be re-examined to prevent the risk of re-infection every 3-6. month. [21]
- There are many medications for ringworm and hookworm, including "over-the-counter" and prescription drugs from a veterinarian. Pyrantel pamoate and Fenbendazole are two over-the-counter drugs that help treat both roundworm and hookworm in dogs. [22]
- Pyrantel is safe for puppies up to 4 weeks of age. However, it's best to consult with your veterinarian before giving your dog any medications. [23]
- If you have a roundworm or hookworm infection, your dog may also need a monthly pill that contains an ingredient that helps prevent roundworm and reinfection. [24]
- Praziquantel and Epsiprantel are two commonly used drugs to treat tapeworms. [25]
- Whipworms can be killed with certain medications such as Fenbendazole or Febantel. Worm treatment usually lasts for 5 days and treatment is repeated within 3 weeks. Dogs may also need a monthly worm-proof pill to prevent whipworms. [26]

### 2.3 Worm treatment is immediate. 

Dogs infected with worms only need to be treated as soon as possible. Only a veterinarian is capable of treating dog worms. [27]
- The severity and damage caused by worms that can only be caused by worms to the dog's heart and lungs should be evaluated by a veterinarian in order to plan appropriate treatment. [28]
- There are steps in a course of basic worm treatment that last only 6-12 months. These steps include oral medication as well as a series of injections (usually three) specifically into the dorsal muscle. [29]
- Worm infection is a very serious condition, and even in severe cases, some dogs cannot survive even with treatment.

## 3. Prevent helminths

![Treat-Worms-in-Dogs-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-treat-dog-worms/v4-728px-Treat-Worms-in-Dogs-Step-14-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Take your dog to the doctor regularly. 

To make sure your dog has a worm infection and gets treated before it worsens, see your veterinarian regularly.
- As a precaution, you should collect a dog stool sample and test it at least once a year. [30]
- If your dog is active outdoors or plays with other dogs, catches and eats prey, or you live in a worm-rich area, you should have your dog tested on a stool sample regularly.

![Treat-Worms-in-Dogs-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-treat-dog-worms/v4-728px-Treat-Worms-in-Dogs-Step-15-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Give your dog a worm suppressant. 

Worm-suppressants are usually cheaper and safer than medications, so you should start giving your puppies 8 weeks of age a worm-proof medication. Many of the only available worm-preventers can also reduce the risk of infection with other types of worms, so it's even more essential to use the anti-worm. [thirty 1]
- There are many worm prevention medications available only and your veterinarian can advise you on the right one. [32]
- The most common anthelmintic drugs are usually available as oral and topical medications.
- Many anti-worms are only effective against fleas and ticks. There is no medicine to prevent all types of parasites, but your veterinarian can help you decide which is best for your dog's health. [33]
- Dogs need to be taken by mouth or on a worm-proof only monthly, although there are injections that can last up to 6 months. This medicine only helps prevent filariasis and is not effective against intestinal helminths.
- If you live in an area where there is no need for filariasis, just give your dog medications that help treat intestinal worms, such as Pyrantel Pamoate, Fenbendazole, and Praziquantel. [34]

### 3.3 Get rid of fleas for dogs. 

Tapeworm infection usually occurs mainly when dogs eat fleas, so getting rid of fleas is the most effective way to prevent tapeworms. [35]
- There are many oral, over-the-counter and over-the-counter medications available to help control fleas and tapeworms effectively in dogs. [36]
- Although not as effective, you can still use a flea collar and bathe your dog regularly. [37]

![Treat-Worms-in-Dogs-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-treat-dog-worms/v4-728px-Treat-Worms-in-Dogs-Step-17-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Remove dog feces. 

Hookworms and whipworms are often spread through feces. You should regularly remove dog feces and prevent your dog from coming into contact with other dogs' waste. [38]

> Advice
- Keep an eye on your dog and contact your veterinarian if you suspect your dog is having problems.
- Clean the yard regularly.
- Always consult your veterinarian before giving your dog any medication.
- Every 6-12 months, you should have your dog tested once, including a stool test and a blood test.

> Warning
- Both filariasis and intestinal helminths can kill dogs if left untreated. You should have your dog checked out regularly or seek professional help if you suspect that your dog has a worm infection.
- If your dog has a severe hookworm infection, your dog may need to be hospitalized for intravenous fluids, even blood transfusions.
- Be careful when handling dog feces, as hookworms and roundworms can be transferred to humans. [39]
- Hookworms can be transmitted to unborn dogs. If your dog is pregnant, you should be especially wary of any signs of worm infection. [40]
