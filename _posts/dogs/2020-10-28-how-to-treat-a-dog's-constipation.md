> Dogs with constipation often have difficulty defecating, have little or no bowel movements. [1] Constipation is a common intestinal problem in dogs due to a variety of causes, including medication, inactivity, and a severe lack of fiber. [2] Like humans, dogs with constipation can be extremely uncomfortable. If your dog is constipated, there are some home remedies you can use to help treat your dog. However, your dog should see the vet right away if the constipation is severe.

## 1. Treat your dog for constipation

### 1.1 Determine if your dog is constipated. 

A common sign of constipation is straining when defecating and only a small amount of dry stools can be squeezed out. [3] You may also find stools sticking around the anus, especially in long haired dogs. The stool can get on the dog's fur and make it harder for the dog to defecate than usual. [4] Although rare, you can also see mucus in the feces when your dog is constipated. [5]
- Straining your dog while defecating will cause tension and pain in your dog. [6]
- You should be aware because these signs of constipation are easy to confuse with some diseases, such as a urinary tract infection. Your vet can help determine if your dog is constipated or has another medical condition. [7]
- If the dog is constipated for several days, other symptoms such as loss of appetite, vomiting, and lethargy occur. You can even see blood around the dog's anus. Should immediately take your dog to the medical clinic if you detect the symptoms listed above. [8] [9]

### 1.2 Clean your dog's anus. 

Make sure to remove any sticky stool from your anus or anything (eg a grass) stuck to the dog's anal area hair. Before you touch your dog's anus, wear rubber gloves. [10] If you are allergic to latex gloves, you can wear nitrile gloves instead.
- If your dog's coat is too long, trim the hair that is stained with the stool. Your dog may or may not like to trim. If your dog doesn't like it, soaking the hair in hot water first will make the trimming process easier. [11]
- Use warm soapy water and a small towel to wipe your dog's anal area. Your dog's anus can become sensitive because he pushes too much. Therefore, you should gently wipe and talk to your dog in the softest voice to reassure him. [12] The dog can stand or lie down while grooming. You should let your dog choose the position that is most comfortable.
- You can apply KY gel to your anus after wiping it to relieve irritation. You can buy KY gel at a pharmacy. [13]

### 1.3 Treatment of constipation. 

Unfortunately, constipation once emerges is often difficult to treat and sometimes an enema is used. You should be aware because oral medications take up to a few days to be able to move to the location requiring treatment at the end of the intestine. So, once constipation has arisen, oral medication may not be the best treatment. However, oral anti-constipation pills are the most effective method of prevention. Your veterinarian may recommend several treatments for constipation, including prescription medications. If you don't know what to give your dog, you can call your veterinarian for advice.
- You can give your dog a stool softener or a laxative. However, these drugs are often too strong for dogs, so you need to ask your doctor to prescribe the right ones for dogs. [14]
- Mix mineral oil with dog food for 1 week. Do not give the dog mineral oil directly to avoid affecting the lungs and causing pneumonia. [15] You can use a spoon to measure 0.5 ml of mineral oil per kilogram of your dog's body weight (1/8 teaspoon equivalent to 0.5 ml). For example, if your dog weighs 20 kg, you can add 10 ml of mineral oil (less than 1 teaspoon) to the dog's food. [16]
- Add a small amount of sugar-free canned pumpkin to dry dog ​​food. Depending on your dog's weight, you can add 1 teaspoon (for dogs weighing less than 12.5 kg), 2 spoons (12.5-25 kg) or 3 tablespoons (> 25 kg) to the food. [17]
- Switch to canned foods to your dog if they usually eat dry food. Canned foods are often wet, so they can move easily in the dog's digestive system. [18] However, only give your dog canned foods for a few days to avoid diarrhea.
- Give your dog 1 / 4-1 / 2 cups of milk. Milk often causes diarrhea, but the lactose in milk can help relieve constipation. [19]
- Every 12-24 hours, you should sprinkle psyllium husk fiber supplements on your dog's food (1/4 teaspoon for dogs <12.5 kg, 1/2 teaspoon for dogs weighing 12,5-25 kg and 1 teaspoon for dogs> 25 kg). The added fiber helps the food pass through the intestines more easily. You can buy over-the-counter fiber supplements at pharmacies. [20]
- Give your dog plenty of fluids when increasing the fiber content of the diet. [21]
- If none of the above methods help relieve your constipation after a week and your dog seems to be getting worse, take your dog to the vet to continue treatment. [22]

## 2. Constipation prevention and control

### 2.1 Add more fiber to your dog's diet. 

Fiber supplementation is a method of preventing / controlling as well as treating constipation. Just like when treating constipation, you can sprinkle psyllium husk fiber powder on your dog's food. In addition, you can also feed your dog a lot of fresh vegetables to increase the fiber content. Carrots, peas, and green beans are all vegetables you can feed your dog. [23]
- Make sure your dog drinks plenty of fluids when adding more fiber. The digestive tract will shed more feces if there is fiber. If the dog does not drink enough water, the feces will not be able to pass through the anus and further constipation in the dog.

### 2.2 Keep your dog active. 

Physical activity stimulates the dog's bowel movements, which in turn can push food easily and prevent bowel obstruction. [24] Don't overdo it with your dog, and instead just walk for 15 minutes a day. [25]

### 2.3 Limit your dog to eat grass. 

Dogs rarely eat grass, but once they do, the grass can cause constipation. You should prevent your dog from eating grass in the yard or while walking. [26]

### 2.4 Take your dog to the toilet regularly. 

If your dog shows signs of wanting to go to the bathroom, let him go outside. Preventing your dog from going to the bathroom makes feces more likely to get stuck in the intestines and increases the risk of constipation. [27]

### 2.5 Groom your dog regularly. 

Long-haired dogs are prone to constipation because the long hair around the anus is susceptible to stools. If you are comfortable trimming your dog, you should soak it in warm water to make it easier to trim. If you are having trouble trimming your anal hair, you can try brushing the dog according to the way you are. [28]
- Dogs can eat their own fur and become constipated if you let them groom themselves. Helping your dog brush or taking him to a grooming shop regularly will help reduce the risk of his dog eating it on his own. [29]

### 2.6 Castrated dog. 

In older male dogs, the prostate gland can enlarge and make it harder for the stool to pass through the intestines. If your veterinarian determines that the cause of your constipation is an enlarged prostate, you should castrate your dog to prevent further constipation. [30]
- Prostate enlargement is only one disease that causes constipation. In addition, perineal hernia or anal sac disease can also cause constipation. If your dog is constantly constipated, you should take your dog to the vet to identify and treat the underlying condition.

> Advice
- Older dogs are more prone to constipation, [31] partly due to being less active than younger dogs. When an old dog is sedentary, intestinal motility often slows down and increases the likelihood of constipation. If you have an old dog, consult your doctor about ways to help prevent constipation.
- In addition to home remedies, your veterinarian may prescribe medications for constipation such as bowel enhancement pills and enema. If constipation seriously affects your dog's health, your veterinarian can give your dog an IV to add more water to the intestinal tract. [32]
- Dogs with joint problems may have difficulty defecating. Your veterinarian may recommend joint pain relief for your dog.
- Intestinal tumors can also cause constipation by compressing and reducing the size of the bowel, rectum, and anus. Your veterinarian can diagnose intestinal tumors for dogs.
