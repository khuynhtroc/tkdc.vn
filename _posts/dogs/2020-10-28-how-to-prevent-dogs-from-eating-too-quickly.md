## 1. Slow down the dog's food

### 1.1 a plate with food. 

Instead of pouring a lot of food onto the plate, use an upside-down bowl to put on the plate. Evenly spread the food in the plate around the bowl. This way if the dog wants to finish all the food he has to walk around the plate or raise his head and lean sideways. [first]
- Just a simple item can help slow down your dog's eating without any special equipment.

### 1.2 Buy a bowl for the dog to eat. 

If you want to buy plastic bowls at the stores, try Brake Fast Bowl or Slow Feeder. They are capless bowls with circles in the middle, when the dog eats the bowl, the dog will be pushed around and the dog is forced to "chase" the food.
- You can also buy crossword dog feeding tools. Your dog will have to push the slides to find food.

### 1.3 Divide your dog's food into sections. 

You can divide the food into a few small plates, spread it around or evenly divide it into a baking tray. In this way, at least he will either eat each piece or have to find each plate.

### 1.4 Place a large rock in the center of the bowl and spread the food evenly around. 

You should only use large stones because otherwise the dog may mistakenly swallow. For puppies, put 2-3 golf balls in a bowl and spread the food around. The dog will have to push the balls aside to eat more slowly. [2]
- You should only use golf balls with puppies because at that size they will not be able to swallow the ball.

### 1.5 Raise the food bowl. 

When all else fails, put the food bowl on the low table or chair. This forces the dog to put his front paw on the table and lean forward, slightly tilting its esophagus, reducing the amount of air swallowed. Your dog's head will also be lifted and it will be easier to burp. [3]

## 2. Deal with fighting behavior while eating

### 2.1 Determine if your dog has an appetite. 

How many dogs do you have? The dog tries to eat quickly because he is afraid another puppy will eat his food clumsily, or maybe he eats quickly to race and get another dog's share. This behavior is called a food scramble. [4]

### 2.2 Divide the food into several bowls. 

Feed the dogs separate bowls that are placed at the top and bottom of the room. This gives each dog a chance to eat alone without pressure to eat with another. If the dog is still trying to eat, move it to another room, out of sight of the other dog. [5]
- This reduces the pressure of fear of being eaten and eliminates the gluttonous dog's competition for food.

### 2.3 Feed your dog regularly. 

We may find that your dog will still rush to eat the leftovers of other dogs because that is their instinct. Feeding your dog at the right time will create an awareness of fighting problems.
- Your dog may have had the unfortunate circumstances of making it feel that a quick bite is necessary. For example, when the owner is late for the dog to be hungry, he will look for the leftovers from the last time. When a new meal comes along, your dog will grab his food and look for leftovers (in another dog's meals) because of the insecure of food.

### 2.4 Train your dog. 

If he likes noise and attention, distract him immediately after eating. Let the dog sit down and play with it. If this is done regularly, the dog will come to you on its own rather than running over to eat with another dog. [6]

### 2.5 Stick with your dog. 

Be patient with your feeding changes. While not everything you can do, we can also find a way to help our dogs. Remember, it will take a long time for him to learn to slow down.
- If you find that your dog is still greedy or aggressive towards food, this may be possessive, not a matter of speed when it comes to food. Most dogs will fight if another dog comes over to him.

## 3. Know the dangers of eating too fast

### 3.1 Know that eating too quickly can cause health problems.

Feeding your dog fast is like throwing raw chicken at an alligator, which can be frustrating. But more than that, swallowing food quickly will cause some potential harm.
- Never skip a habit such as eating too fast. Always keep an eye on the dog to thrive.

### 3.2 Wait for your dog to burp and gas. 

When a dog eats too quickly, at the same time it is swallowing a lot of air. This can lead to a simple reaction of the body like burping or gas and they are completely harmless. [7]

### 3.3 Dogs can choke. 

Dogs eat fast, but do not chew well. This can cause choking if a large piece of food is swallowed down its esophagus. [8]

### 3.4 Watch for signs of bloating. 

Some are: bulging or bulging abdomen, difficulty walking, trying to vomit but not being able, listless, walking slowly. Call your veterinarian immediately if you suspect any of the above. This is an emergency, and it is better not to regret a phone call to avoid ignoring an issue affecting the dog's life. [9]
- Having bloated food can cause the dog's stomach to twisted, blood will not reach the stomach. This could result in serious stomach damage or death. You should take the dog immediately to the vet. There is no home remedy.
