## 1. Help the puppy consume energy

### 1.1 Take the dog for a regular walk. 

Take your puppy out for a walk at least 2 times a day. Your puppy doesn't need to go on a long walk, but you will need to find a way to keep him active until he is tired. Depending on your puppy's size and strength, just make sure your dog is getting enough exercise each day.
- Treat your dog well and make sure he has active exercise every day.

### 1.2 Play with your puppy. 

A bored dog will try to drain energy in another form (unwanted), such as whining, howling, or destroying things. Try to play with your dog twice a day with games like finding objects, chasing, tug of war, or any game the dog likes and keeps him active.
- In addition to the necessary exercise, your puppy loves to be noticed. Puppies will usually only be able to play for a short period of time, and you should divide the exercises into several parts to make them more adaptable. However, you should gradually increase the frequency of playing and walking as your dog gets older.

### 1.3 Give your puppy a toy. 

If you want your puppy to be happy alone when locked in the yard, give your dog plenty of toys to let him forget he is alone.
- Bring lots of toys to your dog. Puppies are generally very fond of balls, squeaky toys, and toys that fake food. These toys can help your puppy forget about sadness as well as stimulate his natural curiosity and desire to chew.[first]

## 2. Train your dog to be alone

### 2.1 Train your puppy to be alone outside. 

You should only keep your dog outside with a secure and secure fence. Begin taking the dog outside for a short 1-5 minutes to get used to. Accept that your dog will be able to groan and bark loudly when pulled outside.
- You need to train your dog to whine and cry won't help either. If you give up, go out with your dog and bring him back in the house and you are giving the dog the opportunity to develop undesirable behavior (dogs will think whining is a happy mastery). Only allow your dog to enter the house when he is completely silent and is willing to lie down.

### 2.2 Praise your dog's correct behavior. 

This is a key point in the training of your dog. As the amount of time spent outdoors increases (be sure to increase the time slowly), praise your dog for his enthusiasm for caring and petting. You can even give your dog treats. The dog will eventually come to terms with that if he is quiet and behave well outside, he will be rewarded.

### 2.3 Slowly increase the puppy's time alone. 

Continue the training by extending the time the dog is left alone outside until the dog stays silent for at least an hour (in good weather). By now, your dog may be coping with the fear of separation when left or alone. From there, the dog can gradually quiet and sleep.
- Make sure the puppies have clean water available.

### 2.4 Consider using products to help calm your dog. 

There are many products available to help calm your puppy when he is alone.[2]Pheromone is a chemical secreted by the dog's body that can ease anxiety in puppies. Dog attractant pheromones (DAP) have been shown to soothe puppies in dog taming classes. [3] Pheromones are available in collars, sprays, wipes or diffusers.

## 3. Train your dog in a crate

### 3.1 Start training the dog in the crate. 

It is extremely important to keep a crib in your home, dog house, igloo, or in a comfortable and warm shack outside to let your dog rest and feel safe. You can put your puppy's bed, blanket and toys in the tent so that the dog feels a space to belong to.
- Know that it takes a while for your dog to get used to a new place. Therefore, be patient to take the time to gently teach your dog to get used to the crate.
- The crate or crate should be large enough for the dog to stand up without having to fold his back or freely rotate the inside.

### 3.2 Teach your dog to get in the crate. 

Start by opening the crate door (crate) and placing any dog ​​treats deep inside the crate.[4] After your dog has entered the crate to eat, say "crib" and gently close the door behind the dog. After your dog has finished eating, open the crate door and praise him.

![Train-or-Help-a-Puppy-Stop-Crying-when-Locked-up-or-Outside-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-train-or-help-your-puppy-stop-moaning-when-locked-outside/v4-728px-Train-or-Help-a-Puppy-Stop-Crying-when-Locked-up-or-Outside-Step-10.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Continue to teach dogs to go into the crate. 

Train your dog several times over a few days and gradually increase the amount of time you leave the puppy inside the crate when the door is closed. Do not let the dog go outside when the dog starts to whine to avoid damaging the dog. Wait for your dog to be quiet, then open the crate door and allow the dog to go outside.

![Train-or-Help-a-Puppy-Stop-Crying-when-Locked-up-or-Outside-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-train-or-help-your-puppy-stop-moaning-when-locked-outside/v4-728px-Train-or-Help-a-Puppy-Stop-Crying-when-Locked-up-or-Outside-Step-11.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Leave a crib when you put the dog inside. 

When you leave the house and need to put your dog inside the crate, don't worry too much about the kennel. You should order your dog to enter the crate as usual and leave the house comfortably. This will prevent your dog from barking at the braised garlic when you leave the house.
- On the other hand, when you get home, get your dog's attention and the puppy will bark happily for you.

![Train-or-Help-a-Puppy-Stop-Crying-when-Locked-up-or-Outside-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-train-or-help-your-puppy-stop-moaning-when-locked-outside/v4-728px-Train-or-Help-a-Puppy-Stop-Crying-when-Locked-up-or-Outside-Step-12.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Don't use a crate or crate as a form of punishment to avoid making the puppy hate it. 

Puppies under 2 months of age should not be left in the crate for more than 4 hours.[5] Puppies cannot hold pee for more than 4 hours. As your dog gets older, you can keep it in the crate for 4 hours. It can be cruel to keep your dog in captivity for more than 4 hours.

> Advice
- Give your dog plenty of chewable toys, soft toys, water, and food when kept outside for long periods of time.
- Never give up. Don't let your emotions get over your dog and encourage your dog to engage in behaviors you don't want. This will only teach spoiled dogs and allow the dog to do what it likes.
- If you get too upset and just want your dog to shut up (many times), don't scold him either. Instead, just made a sudden sound. For example, just gently "shush" an hour. This will keep your dog quiet without hurting his emotions. Simply put, you want to let your dog know about ownership and you just need to keep quiet.
- If your dog groans and howls all night, you can use a pillow that sounds like the Conair Sound Therapy heartbeat from the Bed, Bath, and Beyond brands to calm your dog to sleep.

> Warning
- Some breeds, like hunting dogs and terriers, can bark loudly. Hence, you sometimes have to deal with this certain noise level.
- It is important to note that if your puppy still refuses to quiet and ruin things after applying the above methods, you should bring the dog to see a pet behavior family.
- Scolding a dog when barking or groaning only makes things worse. Your dog will not understand your language except the tone and pitch of the voice. To a dog, it feels like you are yelling at yourself and it should feel fine when it comes to barking.
- Do not hit the dog as this will only make it worse and more aggressive.
