### 1.1 Think carefully before you have more dogs in the house. 

If you are planning to bring more members home, you should first consider a few factors to ensure that you will be able to live with more than one dog at a time. Each puppy will require more time and effort to feed, clean, exercise, play, and also spend an extra amount of money. Also, in the event that one dog is not behaving correctly, it may draw another in, leaving you to face both stubborn dogs. You should also take note of the needs of your current dog; If you are an old dog and don't like your puppy playing around due to weakness or illness, this is not the right time to have more pets in the house. However, maybe the lazy but healthy old dog needs company!

### 1.2 If you are determined that you can control the number of pets you need to feed, train, and care for, you can have more dogs. 

One of the great benefits of keeping multiple pets is that they bond with each other and play with themselves. However, you should also define from the outset that adding a pet means adding responsibility and bonding to ensure a good bond between dogs.

### 1.3 Get your new dog acquainted with his current dog before bringing it home. 

One way to introduce new pets to existing pets is to have them meet first. If your pets get along, you can bring your new pet home. However, if they fight against each other, you should not adopt this dog.
- Keep your new dog away from your current pet on the first day you go home. You should keep your current pet out and let the new dog explore and get used to the house first.
- When handling new pets with pets in your home, choose a neutral spot where your dog is not currently there. Be slow; they may take a while to get used to each other.

### 1.4 Know what might happen when the dogs first meet. 

Leash your dog so that he can communicate with each other. Dogs usually communicate by sniffing each other's buttocks, sniffing each other's noses, and gesturing (walking stiffly, placing one foot on another dog's shoulder, ruffled feathers, etc.). They can make sounds like barking, hums, and growling. [first]This is a dog etiquette, and you should only observe it because most dogs see it as greeting and accepting a fellow; Their actions are hierarchical, and you should wait until the moment asserts that you and the others dominate! Also be aware of the territorial marking behavior. This is a common form of dog communication and a means of determining dominance and social standing, but this can be a problem if it happens in your home. [2] You can use dog training techniques or use products that prevent territorial behavior, such as sprays, dog diapers, and special clothing to prevent this problem.
- Keep a positive attitude . Negative emotions are easy for dogs to recognize. Instead of worrying about it, try to be happy with a new pet in your home. Then the pet will get along with his fellow humans.
- Take notice and keep pets away if you see or hear them growling, pouncing together, making a position about to jump, disregard each other but constantly disturb (common in older / young dogs) , look at each other but do nothing (fight for domination). [3] In these cases, you have to step in and split them up. Then you should slowly get your pet to get acquainted with each other (and you can either have another person walk them on leash to initiate communication).
- Seek professional help if the dogs can't get along. This can happen and you need to get the right advice. You should see a veterinarian, a dog trainer, or an animal behavior specialist.
- Note the hierarchy of dogs. Hierarchy will build up very quickly and the dogs will show you which comes first, eat first, play with friends, etc. [4] You need to reinforce this hierarchy with onions. vi (still in the dominant role) and do not allow the lower level puppy to feel isolated.

### 1.5 Take control of the situation and build bonds with each dog. 

After you have introduced your pets, you will begin to manage your dogs as rulers, not them. This sounds easy, but if you have a lot of dogs in the house, they tend to see you or the rest of the family in a low class (usually due to obedience to your behavior and actions). What's even worse is that many people assume that with multiple dogs they can take care of each other, so they will give up the responsibility of own control and bond with each dog. In fact, you have to spend effort and time with the second, third, fourth, etc., just like with the first.

### 1.6 Do not allow dogs to see subordinate humans being treated. 

Start training your pet and notice your behavior towards the dogs. Train all basic command pets; if the current dog has been trained (before you have a pet), simply test its obedience skills and review the content if necessary, as well as train the new dog to resemble the current dog. in. Ask each pet to see you as the owner and for each family member higher up in the herd. If you do not, they will wage war for dominance and ignore human commands.
- Do not downplay your role. You still have to be the owner, or the "leader." Get each dog to obey and carry out your commands through obedience training. If they do not obey, you should retrain the basics. Don't walk, feed, play, etc., until your pet obeys the command! Also, don't let the dog walk through the door in front of you; retraining if they have this behavior.
- Dog herd training is a science; You should seek knowledge of the subject, and seek advice from a dog trainer if necessary. Effective training is essential to maintaining peace in a home with many dogs.

### 1.7 Train your dogs to get along well with each other. 

If your pet is getting along in the first place, there's no need to worry. This can take a long time to achieve, however, so separate them while you're away from home and slowly let your pets interact with each other while you are at home and increase the amount of time you spend until you are at home. when they can attach themselves. It is important that when you are away from home, pets can play with each other and miss you or the other person.
- Housing training can help in the early stages of getting your dog to get acquainted. Keep pets in the same room so they can see each other.

### 1.8 Recognize signs of aggression. 

Learn your dog's body language and you will see when it is a joke or a real war, as well as when the fight begins. This is no different from observing the first sign of greeting; It is important that you stay alert every time they are together. However, if the dogs get along well and are well trained, they will rarely be stressed out. You need to be aware of times when your pet is sick, fighting for food, getting pregnant or raising a baby, bringing a new pet home, having young children in the house, and when everyone in the family is too busy There is time to care for the pet.
- Note that a dog can be attached to a particular object. If the other dog fails to understand that the object is left untouched, a conflict may arise. Most dogs will understand if they hear a growl. In the event that a problem arises, take the item away while the dog cannot see it.
- No punishment for growling. Dog growls to warn you of discomfort and prevent a conflict from occurring. This act is considered the dog version diplomacy. If you scold them they will no longer growl but feel stressed. Then they can attack without warning.

![Live-in-a-Multi-Dog-Household-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-live-with-dogs/v4-728px-Live-in-a-Multi-Dog-Household-Step-9.jpg.webp)

### 1.9 Give each dog a separate bowl, away from each other, or even confine it in a separate cage or room if there are signs of aggression while eating. 

Feeding the dogs doesn't have to be a fierce struggle. Do not let your pet see that the other dog has more food or better food. Offer each child their own bowl and in a different area at the same time. Feeding in a cage or private room can prevent a problem from arising between the dominant and the treated dog. This is something people want their dogs to avoid, but in the concept of dog behavior this doesn't happen, and too close contact can make the situation more stressful. After you have finished feeding your dog, store all the leftover food so that each dog will not look over to the other dog and start fighting.
- Feed the dominant dog first to prevent hierarchical conflicts.
- When you are feeding your dog the bones, make sure to divide them evenly at the same time. If there are signs of bone contention, keep separate from each dog to prevent the dominant dog from being treated. Even if you have segregated the area with wire, you should still make sure that each dog has its share of bones.
- One bowl of water is enough for the dogs if the water is enough to meet their needs, [5] but if you are in concern, prepare another bowl of water.

### 1.10 Equal attention to each dog but maintains a hierarchical role. 

Dogs are pack animals and have the instinct to classify themselves into positions in the herd. They often do not care about where in the flock, as long as they secure their position. Most of us often think it is fair and reasonable to give a lot of attention to a treated pet, but this unintentionally destroys hierarchy. Dogs will fight if they do not know which one will be the leader. You should feed the dominant dog first, play first, go through the front door and be taken care of first. Do not ignore the treated dog, but only need praise and attention after you have taken care of the dominant dog. This will limit the risk of competing for dominance. [6] [7]

### 1.11 Prepare a separate sleeping area for each dog. 

As with food bowls, keep a separate mattress for each pet. Make sure each child has their own mattress and separate them from them so your pet won't feel out of place. If you do not allocate your own space, the dogs will find their own place to sleep. If you do not like the location they choose, you should train the pet to move to another location. Don't be surprised your pets sleep together; just make sure the resting space is large enough and that each child has its own mattress. [8]

### 1.12 Enjoy the fun with dogs in the house. 

If you feel stressed all the time when your pets are in contact, a fight is likely because they are aware of the owner's feelings and fears. Instead, relax and have a positive attitude!
- Make sure your pet has fun at all times. Prepare lots of toys and change to new toys if old ones are damaged. Buy toy bones, zippers, balls, etc. to make them easy to access whenever you want to play. If your dogs are of different sizes, you should buy toys that match their size.
- Practice your pet regularly. This method helps to release excess energy and minimizes the pet's frequent barking that disturbs neighbors.

- If your dog has different hygienic needs, make time for your puppy that doesn't need to be too hygienic by petting and petting him.
- Adult dogs can be annoyed with puppies or playful; If you want to find friends for your current dog, choose an adult dog.

> Warning
- The quiet puppy still needs as much care as a mischievous dog. You need to give equal love to your dogs.
- If your pet starts to go to war, you should contact a trainer. Don't interfere with their aggressive behavior yourself! Learn how to end the fight safely; Do your research thoroughly before adopting a new pet. At a minimum, you should throw a blanket at the dogs so they will not be aware of their actions and give you the opportunity to separate them.
- If your dog is in heat, you should have it sterilized to prevent aggressive behavior and unwanted puppy birth. During this time your dog will behave erratically and aggressively, causing problems if you ignore them.
- An agitated dog may become aggressive, though not intentionally. Eating times, returning from absenteeism, and playtime can put some of your dogs under pressure, so be cautious if your dog is agitated. [9]
