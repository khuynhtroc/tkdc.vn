## 1. Check the dog's body

### 1.1 Observe the dog's mouth. 

Your dog's gums and tongue can vary from bluish gray to pinkish. If your dog's gums naturally turn black, watch for the tongue. If the gums or tongue are green, purple, white, brick red, or bright red, take your dog to the vet immediately. A change in color of the gums and tongue indicates poor blood circulation throughout the body. [first]
- You can also use the "capillary blood timing to return to normal" (CRT) method to check for toxins that are blocking blood circulation. Push your dog's upper lip up, while pressing his canine gums with his thumb. Release your thumb, then check the color of the position you just pressed. Normally, the color of the gums will change from white to pink within 2 seconds. [2] If it takes longer (more than 3 seconds), you should take your dog to the vet immediately.

### 1.2 Check your heart rate. 

If the dog's heart rate is above 180 beats / min, the dog can be poisoned and should see the vet immediately. The normal resting heart rate of an adult dog is about 70-140 beats / minute. Larger dogs usually have a slower heart rate.
- You can check and feel your dog's heartbeat by placing your hand on the left chest, behind the elbow. To calculate your heart rate per minute, you would count your heart rate for 15 seconds, then multiply by 4. [3]
- To be sure, write down your dog's normal heart rate in a notebook to see when needed. Some dogs are born with a heartbeat faster than normal.

### 1.3 Check your dog's temperature with a thermometer. 

A dog's normal temperature range is about 38-39 degrees Celsius. [4] A dog with a fever is unlikely to be poisoned, but a fever can be a sign of many other illnesses. Stress or agitation can be a sign of hyperthermia in your dog. If your dog is lethargic, ill and has hyperthermia, you should contact your veterinarian immediately. [5]
- Have someone help you measure your dog's temperature. One person holds the dog's head so the other pushes the thermometer into the rectum under the dog's tail. Use grease wax or water containing KY lubricant to lubricate the thermometer. You should use a digital thermometer.

## 2. Identify changes in behavior

### 2.1 Check your dog's balance. 

If the dog is dizzy, disoriented, or dizzy, the dog may have a nervous or heart problem or hypoglycemia due to poisoning. Should take your dog to the veterinarian as soon as you see signs of imbalance. [6]

### 2.2 Watch for signs of vomiting and diarrhea. 

Vomiting and diarrhea are both unusual signs. Dogs seem to be attempting to expel foreign toxins with vomiting and diarrhea. You should check your dog's color, consistency, and what is in his feces / vomit. If normal, dog feces are usually thick and brown in color. Contact your veterinarian right away if the dog's feces are loose, yellow, green, or black.

### 2.3 Pay attention to the dog's breathing. 

It is normal and common for dogs to gasp for heat. However, panting, heavy and lasting for more than 30 minutes indicates a problem with the dog's breathing or heart. If you notice that your dog is wheezing or interrupted, you should take your dog to the vet right away, as he may ingest something toxic to his lungs. [7]
- You can determine the dog's breathing rate in 1 minute by observing the dog's chest, counting the number of times the dog breathes in 15 seconds, then multiplying by 4. The normal breathing rate of the dog is about 10-30 times / minute.

### 2.4 Watch for signs of anorexia. 

Suddenly stopping eating could be a sign the dog has ingested the poison. Call your veterinarian right away if the dog refuses to eat for more than 24 hours. [8]

## 3. Call for relief

### 3.1 Write down your dog's symptoms in detail. 

Write down the initial symptoms of poisoning and the measures you took to relieve these symptoms. The more information you provide, the better expert support you will get.
- Do not give your dog any water after it has been poisoned. Water can facilitate the spread of toxins throughout the body. [9]

![Recognize-Poisoning-in-Dogs-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-recognize-the-signs-of-poisoning-in-dogs/v4-728px-Recognize-Poisoning-in-Dogs-Step-9-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Identify the source of the poison. 

Walk around your home and yard to identify poisons such as rat poison, antifreeze, fungus, or fertilizers. Watch out for overturned cans, damaged prescription bottles, spilled liquids, or spilled household chemicals. [ten]
- If you suspect your dog has ingested a hazardous product, check the safety warning on the packaging. Most products with harmful ingredients often print the company's phone number on the package so that customers can call for advice. Here are the most frequently consumed toxic substances that dogs eat:
- Forest mushrooms (need to check each fungus in the reference text)
- Walnuts are moldy
- Oleander
- Tuberose / Tuberose lily
- Van youth
- Cilantro tree
- Household hygiene products
- Snail residue (containing metaldehyde)
- Pesticides
- Herbicide
- Some fertilizers
- Chocolate (especially dark or pastry chocolates)
- Xylitol (sugar-free gum)
- Macadamia seeds
- Onion
- Grapes / raisins
- Fermented dough
- Alcohol (alcohol) [11]

### 3.3 Call a poison control center or veterinarian. 

Poison hotlines aren't just for people. Poisons can have the same effect on both humans and dogs, so a poison control representative can advise you. [12] Besides, you can also call a veterinarian. You should describe symptoms and possible causes of toxicity.[13] Talk to your veterinarian about any problems with dog poisoning. Ask your veterinarian if the poisoning symptom you have just presented requires immediate medical attention.
- Do not force your dog to vomit without instructions. After 2 hours, the poison can be expelled from the stomach after vomiting. [14] However, if the dog has difficulty breathing, is dizzy, or loses consciousness, forcing the dog to vomit can cause the dog to choke during vomiting. [15]

### 3.4 Take the dog to the vet. 

Time is a key factor in treating dog poisoning. If symptoms persist after your veterinarian makes the initial diagnosis, take your dog to the vet immediately. Find the nearest vet within 24 hours if symptoms persist for more than 1 week or appear overnight.
