> Some people want to make their own dog food because of concerns that pet food is not nutritious or may not be hygienic. This is an issue that cannot be taken lightly. Dog food is usually safe and fulfills the dog's nutritional needs, which are not the same as that of humans. [1] To make dog food, to meet their nutritional needs, you need to learn about that nutritional need and create a mixture of meat, vegetables and starches that satisfy these needs.

## 1. Evaluate your dog's nutritional needs

### 1.1 Talk to your veterinarian before switching to homemade dog foods. 

Your dog can explain it to you if your dog has specific nutritional needs. Your doctor can also recommend important ingredients that are good for your pet's health.
- After feeding your dog homemade foods for a few weeks, take them to the vet to make sure they are not gaining or losing weight. If this happens, talk to your doctor about your dog's diet to adjust. [2]

### 1.2 Consult with an animal nutritionist. 

If your veterinarian has no knowledge of homemade dog foods, consult an animal nutritionist. An expert will help you develop a homemade diet that's suitable for your dog. This is very important if your dog has a chronic health problem.

### 1.3 Consider your dog's caloric needs. 

For example, puppies need more calories and more nutritious food than adult dogs because their bodies are growing fast and forming bones and muscles. Older dogs need fewer calories than adults because of a slower metabolism.
- Older dogs still need quality and nutritious food. They also need more fiber to help digest food.
- Pregnant or nursing dogs need more calories to meet the body's needs for pregnancy.
- Small dogs, on average, have a higher metabolism than larger dogs. Therefore, smaller dogs need more calorie and nutritious food than larger dogs.
- The small puppy food is different from the larger puppy as well. Larger puppies often suffer from skeleton problems, so attention should be paid to ensuring the balance of nutrients such as protein, calcium and phosphorus to form the skeletal system.

### 1.4 Avoid giving your dog inappropriate food as it could make them sick; and in some cases even damage to body parts that can lead to the dog's death. 
Never give your dog the following foods:
- Alcohol-based beverages
- Avocado
- Sweets, especially chocolate
- Garlic, garlic powder, onion, onion powder
- Grapes
- Macadamia nuts
- Mushroom
- Rapeseed
- Raisins
- Salt
- Walnuts
- Bread
- Any food that contains xylitol, an artificial sweetener, is toxic to dogs.

### 1.5 Cycle through food to create a varied and balanced diet. 

Be aware that your dog's diet consists of 40% meat, 30% vegetables and 30% carbs. When following this diet, you can provide your dog with vitamins and minerals every day to help him get the proper nutrition.

## 2. Make minced meat balls mixed with liver

### 2.1 Prepare each ingredient. 

Signature menus for home-made dog food include meats, vegetables and mixed cereals. Crush the blueberries into a thick, soft sauce. Cook minced meat balls, liver, oats, and rice.
- Let cooked ingredients cool to a touchable level. This will make it easier to mix the ingredients.

### 2.2 Mix the ingredients together. 

First put the beef, cooked oats and liver in a food processor. The goal is to make a fairly fine, slightly lumpy mixture. Then add other ingredients to make sure it's easy to mix with the original mixture.

### 2.3 Squeeze the mixture into small cubes of 1/4 cup to divide the portion uniformly. 

Place the pellets in the refrigerator.

### 2.4 Feed the dog. 

Food needs to be eaten immediately. Feed a 5 to 7.5 kg dog with about 1 cup of food twice daily.
- Keep cooked food in the refrigerator for no more than 3 days. Remember that when you use natural ingredients, food spoils easily. You should only make enough food for a few days, depending on the shelf life of the ingredients.

## 3. Make a veggie-mixed meat cake

### 3.1 Prepare to make dog food. 

Turn on oven at 180˚C. Sweep a layer of cooking oil on a large baking pan, set aside for later.

### 3.2 Mix the ingredients with your hands in a large bowl. 

Make sure to wash your hands well before mixing. The consistency of the mixture will not be high, but they still stick together thanks to raw meat and eggs.

### 3.3 Divide the mixture into 4 equal parts. 

Put each part in the cake mold. Place the cake mold on the previous baking pan and cover the lid tightly.

### 3.4 Bake for about 80 minutes or until meat is evenly cooked. 

If you are using a meat thermometer, the internal temperature of the meat should be 80˚C when finished. [5] Then cool the food.

### 3.5 Feed the dog. 

Dogs weighing 5 kg eat from 1/4 to 1/3 of meat pie. [6] This food can also be given to your dog along with crushed food to diversify his diet. [7]
