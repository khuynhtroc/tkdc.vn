> Cynophobia, also known as cynophobia, is a very common phobia. Phobia is classified as a specific phobia, as opposed to phobia. In general, phobia is a persistent, irrational, and uncontrollable fear of something (an object, situation or activity). [1] A characteristic of fear of dogs is an irrational and uncontrollable fear of dogs. However, the degree of fear can vary from person to person. Some people may feel scared when they see dogs, others even thinking about dogs is scared. Whatever your fear of dogs, there are ways to help you overcome it.

## 1. Determine your fear level

![Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-1]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-overcome-fear-of-dogs/v4-728px-Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-1-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.1 Consider your dog contact history. 

While not all, many people develop dreaded dogs from childhood. If you have experienced one of the situations listed below, that is probably what is causing you to be afraid of dogs. [2]
- You may have had a bad experience with one or more dogs before. You may have been threatened, chased or even bitten by a dog, and now that is the only memory of the dog that remains in your mind. Confronting dogs today can have the same bad feeling, leaving you feeling scared of dogs in all situations.
- You may have unintentionally received the fear of dogs from someone, such as your parents. Maybe when you grow up, your mother always talks about dogs in a negative way, or tells you stories about people attacked by dogs. Mom's fear will definitely pass on to you. Maybe you don't know anything else about dogs and grew up thinking all dogs are horrible, and that is probably the cause of your fear of dogs. It's even possible that your anxiety is related to the disorder inherited from the family.
- You may have witnessed a bad thing dogs do to someone. Maybe you've seen someone attacked and injured by a dog, or you've even watched a dog movie at an emotional age. This fact, whether real or fictional, can cause you to develop a phobia even if nothing happens to yourself. [3]

### 1.2 Analyze your symptoms. 

Specific phobias, including phobias, can include several of the following symptoms. [4] In addition to looking at the symptoms you might experience, think about the circumstances in which you experienced the experience. Did the appearance of a dog frighten you, or did just a picture or story of the dog cause your symptoms? Are you afraid of the dog itself or of his actions? For example, some people are scared to see a dog barking, but don't feel scared when the dog is silent.
- There is a sense of imminent danger.
- The feeling of the need to run away or hide.
- Rapid heartbeat, sweating, shivering, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, dizziness or coldness.
- It feels like it's not real.
- Feeling out of control or going crazy.
- Feelings can die.

### 1.3 Determine if you changed your life for that fear. 

Unfortunately, fear can be so severe that we feel that the best way to dispel fear is to avoid it completely. While phobias such as fear of flying can be fairly easily avoided simply by never flying, fear of dogs is another. There are over 60 million dogs in the United States alone, so it's almost impossible to avoid a dog at all. Ask yourself if you are doing the following to avoid being around a dog. If so, you most likely have dog phobia. [5]
- Do you avoid socializing with certain people because they have dogs?
- Do you completely change course to avoid certain homes or houses with dogs?
- Do you avoid talking to people because they talk about their dogs?

![Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-4]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-overcome-fear-of-dogs/v4-728px-Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-4-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.4 Understand that there is a way to overcome your fear of dogs. 

While this fear can be overcome, remember that you need to be patient. That fear doesn't go away right away, it takes effort. Perhaps you should consider seeking professional help from a therapist to get through the process of overcoming your phobia. [6]
- Consider recording your fears in a journal. Write down your outstanding memories of your dog and how you felt during those experiences.
- Learn meditation and relaxation techniques to stay calm and manage your nervousness.
- Divide your fears into smaller chunks to overcome; Don't think you need to deal with everything for a while. [7]
- Believe in yourself that you will overcome your fear of dogs. Accept all your mistakes in that journey.

### 1.5 Seek the help of a qualified therapist. Although not required, a therapist can help you overcome your fears and anxiety with psychotherapy. Therapists have a very high success rate in treating patients with phobias. They may use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to help you change the way you think. They can teach you skills to overcome your fear. A therapist can also use contact therapy to help you regain emotional control in your dog's presence. [8]
Consider finding a therapist in your area through the American Association for Depression and Anxiety (ADAA). Go to your zip code to find a list of therapists near you. This list will include the disorders of each therapist's specialty so that you can choose a therapist for specific phobia or canine phobia.

## 2. Cognitive changes

![Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-overcome-fear-of-dogs/v4-728px-Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-6-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Understand what cognitive change is. 

Many phobias, including the fear of dogs, are more explained by the brain about a situation than the reality of the situation. For example, maybe you are not really afraid of the dog in front of you, but your brain interprets the dog as a threat, thereby scaring you. Cognitive changes help you identify those thoughts, understand that they are irrational, and gradually help you change (or correct) your thoughts about a particular situation (like dogs, for example). ). [9]
- It is important to change your perception with an open and ready mind. Accept the fact that your fear may not be based on rational thinking, and that also means you can train yourself to think differently. If you enter this treatment in a pessimistic or in the belief that your fears are justified, you will make the treatment more difficult. [ten]

![Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-overcome-fear-of-dogs/v4-728px-Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-7-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Consider fear-provoking events. 

The first step in overcoming fear is to determine the basis of fear. This step may involve thinking or talking about past experiences with your dog, and also figuring out what key things might trigger your phobia. You can also narrow the scope of the exact cause of fear. Are you afraid of a dog in common, or do you become scared when the dog does something specific (eg growling, barking, jumping, running, etc.) [11]
- You and your therapist can also determine if there is an underlying medical condition or mental condition that aggravates your phobia. The underlying cause could be an anxiety disorder, depression, or even a specific unrelated event that can trigger phobias.
- This is also a good time to start journaling, where you can keep a record of all the information about your dread, and this can help with therapy and analysis. Record in your diary each event in your memory, and everything that led to that event you remember.

![Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-overcome-fear-of-dogs/v4-728px-Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-8-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Analyze the events that you believe are the triggers. 

Once you have a clear understanding of the specific events that trigger your phobia, you need to evaluate what you think when the fear arises. What are you talking to me? How would you interpret that stimulating event in your mind? What confidence do you believe about the event the moment it appears? [twelfth]
- Keep journaling of your memories and thoughts. At this point start writing down the reasons you think the events are frightening. Write down everything you remember about your beliefs during those times.
- Analyze your beliefs and thoughts to see if they include any of the following: [13] 
- All or nothing - do you think EVERY dog is bad, whatever? Or do you oddly distinguish dogs based on traits? For example, "I can't be friends with anyone who has dogs."
- So, yes , need - do you look at a dog and assume you must be afraid of it? Do you feel like you have no other option in that case? For example, "Mom told me never to trust a dog."
- Exaggerated generalization - have you tried to overcome your fear of dogs in the past but are unsuccessful, and now do you think you will never be able to overcome that fear? For example, “I tried to get close to a dog before, but it didn't work. I have no choice but to be afraid of dogs. "
- Mental Filter - Are you automatically drawing conclusions about the dog based on one or two previous dog experiences? For example, "That dog attacked me when I was three years old, the dog is so bad, they will attack humans if given the chance."
- Take positives lightly - are you ignoring good things because you don't believe it will happen again? For example, "Yes, I can sit next to that dog, but he is so old and sick that he can't walk anymore and attack me."
- Conclusion rushed - did you see or hear a dog and automatically draw conclusions about what was going to happen? For example, "These are pit bulls, they are terribly aggressive and cannot be properly trained."

![Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-overcome-fear-of-dogs/v4-728px-Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-9.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 Examine the feelings and behaviors that stem from your beliefs. 

At this point you should understand what triggers your phobia, what thoughts and beliefs about dogs when those triggers appear. Now is the time to analyze the thoughts and beliefs that really impacts how to feelings and your behavior. In other words, what are the consequences of that fear? What is your fear of “sending” you to do something? [15]
- Continue to journal. At this stage you need to write down your reactions (both internal and external) to the events that cause your fear and the beliefs that contribute to that fear.
- The possible reactions are:
- You walk down the street and encounter a dog in some yard. From then on you never go down that street again.
- Your neighbor has a dog and they let them play in the backyard, so you never go into your backyard if your neighbor's dog is outside.
- You refuse to go to a friend's house because they have a dog, and you cannot go out with that friend if they bring the dog.

![Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-overcome-fear-of-dogs/v4-728px-Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-10.jpg.webp)

### 2.5 See if there is evidence to support your beliefs. 

Now is the time to analyze what triggers your fear, why it arises, and how you react to it. Now is the time to analyze whether there is really any evidence to support your fear of dogs. Think of this as part of the process when you need to show your therapist (or yourself) that your fears are completely justified. [16]
- Journal each of your beliefs and relevant evidence to show that what you believe is true and reasonable. If you really have a reason, can you find any scientific evidence to support your beliefs?
- For example, you believe that every dog ​​will attack you, no matter what. Why do you think this is true? Did all the dogs you meet attack you? Would someone else be attacked by every dog ​​they met? Why do people still keep dogs as pets if they are constantly being attacked by dogs?

![Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-overcome-fear-of-dogs/v4-728px-Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-11.jpg.webp)

### 2.6 Develop valid interpretations of the event that triggers fear. 

You have been trying to prove your fear of dogs perfectly right at this point, but you can't find any evidence to support your beliefs. In fact, you may find the opposite evidence again. Now is the time to reflect on the beliefs that cause these fears and work with a therapist to develop valid interpretations of your beliefs. These logical interpretations begin to make sense and make you realize that the fear is irrational. [17]
- This sounds easy, but it will be the most difficult step in overcoming your fear of dogs. Trust can be deeply rooted in our minds, so it takes time (and persuasion) for us to realize that belief is not valid. After all, those irrational beliefs can help you avoid bad situations, so what's wrong with them?
- For example, you believe that all dogs are aggressive. You cannot find any evidence to support that belief, so why do you still believe it? Maybe your belief stems from a movie you watched from the age of seven (which you shouldn't have seen) in which dogs attack and kill people. After watching that movie, you start to fear dogs because you are 100% sure that the movie is correct. In reality, it is just movies and there is no truth in it. And if you look closely, you will find that you never actually see that happening in real life.

![Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-overcome-fear-of-dogs/v4-728px-Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-12.jpg.webp)

### 2.7 Go to the next step in your recovery journey. 

Although you have come a long way by this point, your journey is not complete. While you can convince yourself that your fear has no valid interpretations and no reason to fear it, you are not really “cured”. Once you have completed the theory, you will need to complete the hands-on part of the therapy. At this stage you need to practice with dogs. [18]
- First, you need to learn to relax when your fear or suspense rises so you don't falter.
- Next, you must gradually interact with the dog (in many ways) until you are comfortable with it.

## 3. Learn relaxation techniques

![Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-overcome-fear-of-dogs/v4-728px-Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-13.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Understand different relaxation techniques. 

There are several types of relaxation you can learn to help reduce your fear and anxiety. There are several methods such as: spontaneous relaxation; dynamic relaxation, muscle tension - slack; imagine; deep breath; hypnosis; Massage; meditation; Thai Cuc kungfu; yoga; biological feedback; music and art therapy. [19]
- Spontaneous relaxation is a technique that uses visual images and body sensations while repeating words to help relax and relieve the tension of the muscles.
- Dynamic, stretching - muscle relaxation is the technique of tensing and relaxing each muscle in the body to feel the muscles in both tension and relaxation.
- Imagination is the technique of visualizing specific scenes to provide a sense of relaxation and peace (eg a forest, a beach with waves, etc.)
- Deep breathing is a technique that focuses on breathing deeply from the diaphragm to release stress and cure rapid breathing. [20]
- Biofeedback is a technique in which you learn to control each function in your body, such as heart rate or breathing. [21]

![Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-overcome-fear-of-dogs/v4-728px-Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-14.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Practice deep breathing relaxation. 

When you are nervous or scared, you can respond by breathing too quickly. Too much rapid breathing can increase feelings of anxiety and fear, making the situation worse. Deep breathing can help relax you, reduce stress and reduce anxiety. Follow these steps to relax with deep breathing: [22]
- Sit or stand somewhere that you feel comfortable with and keep your back straight. One hand is on the chest and the other on the stomach.
- Take a slow, deep breath through your nose for a count of four. The hand on the stomach should be raised, while the hand on the chest does not move much.
- Hold your breath while counting to seven.
- Exhale through your mouth as you count to eight. Push as much air out of the lungs as possible using the abdominal muscles. That is, the hand on the abdomen must move down, and the hand on the chest should not move much.
- Repeat these steps until you feel calmer and more relaxed.

![Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-overcome-fear-of-dogs/v4-728px-Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-15.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Perform dynamic relaxation, muscle tension - relaxation. 

People who are anxious often experience stress even when they think they are relaxed. The dynamic, tense - relax relaxation method can help you differentiate muscles from tension and relaxation so you know what true relaxation really is. Practice the following steps twice a day until you feel it working. [23]
- Find a quiet place where you can sit comfortably with your eyes closed. Take off your shoes.
- Do your best to relax your body and take five deep breaths.
- Start with a specific muscle group (for example, your left leg) and focus on those muscles.
- Work with each muscle group: each foot; legs and feet; the whole leg; each hand; whole arm; buttocks; stomach; chest; neck and shoulders; mouth; eye; and forehead.
- Take a slow, deep breath as you stretch the selected muscles for 5 seconds. Make sure to feel the tension before moving on.
- Relax selected muscles as you exhale.
- Pay close attention to how the muscles feel when they are tense and when they relax.
- Relax for 15 seconds, then select another muscle group and repeat the steps above.

![Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-overcome-fear-of-dogs/v4-728px-Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-16.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Try guided visualization. Using visualization to relax is exactly what this method is all about as its name suggests. 

This method requires you to imagine something you find extremely relaxing to ease your nervousness and fear. There will be audio recording to guide you through the process. There are many tutorials available online, some with background music or sound effects for a more realistic feel. [24]
- These recordings guide you to prepare and what to do. They come in different lengths, so you can choose which ones work best for you.

## 4. Treatment with exposure therapy

![Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-overcome-fear-of-dogs/v4-728px-Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-17.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Develop an exposure plan. 

The main reason you learn relaxation techniques is to stay calm as you gradually interact with your dog. But before you start letting your dog show up in front of you, you need to make a plan. This plan covers every step you have to go through from this point (without the dog) to the actual arrival of the dog. [25]
- The plan should be tailored to your unique fear type and the situations you experience. You need to write a list in order from least afraid to most frightening so that you can step by step conquer the most terrifying situation for you.
- An example of a dreaded dog remediation plan would look like this:
 -Step 1 - draw a picture of a dog on paper.
 -Step 2 - read information about dogs.
 -Step 3 - Look at the pictures of the dogs.
 -Step 4 - watch videos about dogs.
 -Step 5 - look at your dog through a closed window.
 -Step 6 - look at the dog through the partially open window.
 -Step 7 - look at the dog through the open window.
 -Step 8 - Look at the dog through the doorway.
 -Step 9 - Look at the dog from outside the doorway.
 -Step 10 - Look at a dog (with leash) in the next room.
 -Step 11 - look at a dog (with leash) in the same room.
 -Step 12 - sit next to a dog.
 -Step 13 - pet a dog.

![Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-overcome-fear-of-dogs/v4-728px-Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-18.jpg.webp)

### 4.2 Use the scale of suspense. 

Use a scale of your anxiety level, where 0 is completely relaxed and 100 is the most frightening / anxious / annoying level you have ever experienced. [26] This is a powerful tool for keeping track of how your fears change over time. [27]
- A fear scale can also help you decide when to move on to the next step in your exposure plan.
- Be patient and slow. Don't move on to the next step too quickly. [28]

![Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-overcome-fear-of-dogs/v4-728px-Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-19.jpg.webp)

### 4.3 Get the help of a trusted friend who has a dog. 

At some point in the plan, you will have to put yourself in a situation where a real dog will appear. You need someone able and reliable to handle a dog, and the dog has to be well trained and predictable. Talk to the dog owner in advance about the plan you want to work on and paraphrase what you are trying to accomplish. They will have to be patient and understanding, although they may just be sitting there for a while with their dog while you adjust to the dog's presence. [29]
- Practicing with puppies is not a good idea, even if you think they are cuter and not aggressive. Puppies are not well trained and difficult to guess. They may act unexpectedly in front of you and will only aggravate your fear.
- Finally, if possible, ask your friend to teach you some basic commands so you can control the dog yourself. Being in control of your dog can help alleviate your fears once you realize that you are able to control their actions.

![Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-overcome-fear-of-dogs/v4-728px-Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-20.jpg.webp)

### 4.4 Start dealing with the fear of dogs. 

Start implementing the first item in the plan. Repeat several times until you feel less nervous and frightened about the practice. If you are taking steps that will allow you to stand in place (like watching your dog through a window, for example), gradually increase the time you spend in the act. Use the relaxation techniques you practice to stay calm. [30]
- Use a journal to keep track of your progress. Record all of your efforts and their effectiveness. Evaluate how much anxiety and fear you have before and after you try to do something.
- Remember that the approach to dog contact should be planned, long-term and repetitive.
- Don't be impatient. Take each step in the plan slowly until you feel comfortable moving on to the next.

![Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-21]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-overcome-fear-of-dogs/v4-728px-Overcome-a-Fear-of-Dogs-Step-21.jpg.webp)

### 4.5 Regular practice. 

This is the most difficult part of the recovery process that you must overcome, but the only way to succeed is to keep on trying. Schedule regular practice. If possible, practice it every day. Reward yourself for your progress. If necessary, you can include a reward item in your plan for more goals to aim for in each step. [thirty first]

> Advice
- Once you've overcome your dog phobia, try playing with your dog if you know someone who has an easy dog. Observing how your dog plays can help you gain a better understanding of how to interact with it.
