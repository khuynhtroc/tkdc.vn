### 1.4 Make a schedule for your dog to eat. 

Chihuahuas cannot eat much at once because of their small stomachs. You should feed your dog several times a day. Very small Chihuahua puppies (under 1.5 kg) may need to be fed every 4 hours. [9] Larger Chihuahua dogs that can be eaten 2-3 times per day should be sufficient. [ten]
- The number of times you feed your Chihuahua will depend on the dog's age, activity level, and health care needs.
- Try out different feeding schedules to determine the one that is best for you and your dog.
- Instead of feeding your dog at the correct time each day, give him the same amount of time. This way your puppy will not fuss over when it's time to eat.
- Wait 15-20 minutes for the Chihuahua to eat, and don't let the others come near during the meal - don't let your dog feel like he's protecting his food.

- Sterilization helps prevent pregnant dogs and ovarian cancer, reduces the risk of breast cancer and prevents heat.
- A castrated male dog will be less likely to roam or become aggressive, increase concentration and prevent or reduce the risk of many different diseases, including hernia and prostatitis. [41]

## 4. Train your Chihuahua

![Care-for-Your-Chihuahua-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-chihuahua-dogs/v4-728px-Care-for-Your-Chihuahua-Step-13.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Give your Chihuahua moderate intensity exercises. 

Chihuahuas are very active animals. If you have an adult Chihuahua, you will be surprised where your dog gets so much energy to run and play. [42] However, it is important to understand that Chihuahuas dissipate energy in short bursts rather than long periods of time. [43]
- Short walks are good exercise for your Chihuahua. [44] Chihuahuas are susceptible to tracheal damage, so be sure to use a flap instead of the usual leash when taking your dog for a walk. [45]
- Chihuahuas can be injured from overtraining. [46] You need to end your training session before your dog becomes exhausted.

![Care-for-Your-Chihuahua-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-chihuahua-dogs/v4-728px-Care-for-Your-Chihuahua-Step-14.jpg.webp)

### 4.2 Schedule regular play with your Chihuahua. 

Regular play is also a great way to get your Chihuahua active. Chihuahuas are fond of fetch, so you can play with your dog while playing. [47] If you have a yard in your house with a fence around it, you can let your dog go outside to chase squirrels. [48]
- Schedule your play with Chihuahua based on your conditions. Try to play with your puppy at the same time each day.
- Limit the time you spend outdoors in Chihuahua when the weather is hot. [49] When taking your dog outside, keep a bowl of clean cold water nearby to prevent dehydration. [50]
- Watch out when Chihuahua plays outdoors. Chihuahuas' small size makes them easy prey for hawks and other birds. [51] Additionally, Chihuahuas are also very curious - and curiosity can prompt them to escape if given the chance. [52]

![Care-for-Your-Chihuahua-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-chihuahua-dogs/v4-728px-Care-for-Your-Chihuahua-Step-15.jpg.webp)

### 4.3 Take your Chihuahua to a dog park. 

Running and playing in the park are great exercises for the Chihuahua, and your puppy also has the opportunity to interact with other dogs. [53] Make sure your dog is well-communicated before going to the park. If you are unfamiliar, a Chihuahua may be hostile, even aggressive, with other dogs.
- Chihuahuas forget how small they are, and will even play against larger dogs when the opportunity arises. [54]

## 5. Train Chihuahua

![Care-for-Your-Chihuahua-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-chihuahua-dogs/v4-728px-Care-for-Your-Chihuahua-Step-16.jpg.webp)

### 5.1 Let Chihuahua go to a puppy "kindergarten" class. 

Enter a name for your puppy in a class that teaches your puppy basic communication skills with other dogs. [55] Chihuahuas are sometimes difficult to get along with, [56] so exposing them to other dogs from a young age will help them become more comfortable and friendly as they grow up.

![Care-for-Your-Chihuahua-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-chihuahua-dogs/v4-728px-Care-for-Your-Chihuahua-Step-17.jpg.webp)

### 5.2 Let Chihuahua take an obedience training class. 

This training class is suitable for Chihuahuas that are no longer puppies and can teach them to be a good dog when they are grown up. These classes will teach dogs to follow basic commands (such as "sit", "still") and make them more comfortable interacting with humans and other dogs. [57]
- Chihuahuas are very intelligent and very receptive. [58]
- Chihuahuas are also very stubborn sometimes, so you need to be patient but be determined when training them. [59]
- If you can't afford a training class, teach your dog how to sit, stay, run until called, and lie down. You can also give your Chihuahua a walking rope.

![Care-for-Your-Chihuahua-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-chihuahua-dogs/v4-728px-Care-for-Your-Chihuahua-Step-18.jpg.webp)

### 5.3 Teach Chihuahua to go to the toilet. 

Like any other training, teaching a Chihuahua to use the toilet is relatively easy. Take your dog out regularly and regularly to let him know that he is not going to use the toilet in the house. [60] For example, your chihuahua puppies should be allowed out after eating, after play, after waking up, and before going to bed. [sixty-one]
- If your dog walks out of town, clean it up, and don't yell at him. You will not be able to teach your dog not to do this by sticking its nose in the waste, yelling, or punishing the dog physically. If you do, you will only scare him away. [62]

![Care-for-Your-Chihuahua-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-chihuahua-dogs/v4-728px-Care-for-Your-Chihuahua-Step-19.jpg.webp)

### 5.4 Make rules. 

If not well trained, your dog can become difficult to handle. [63] In addition to taking training classes, make sure that you set the necessary rules around the house so that your dog won't be stubborn. [64] For example, you can give your dog a place to sleep and have to wait to eat.
- The undisciplined Chihuahua can be arbitrary and very demanding, [65] without the desire or motivation to behave properly.

![Care-for-Your-Chihuahua-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-chihuahua-dogs/v4-728px-Care-for-Your-Chihuahua-Step-20.jpg.webp)

### 5.5 For the socially Chihuahua. 

Courtesy is essential in the care of your Chihuahua. It's a good idea to socialize your dog from a young age - the more you do this when the dog is young, the more likely it will be to mature as an adult. [66] Although your Chihuahua will learn communication skills in the puppy class and obedience training, you can also teach your dog yourself by exposing him to new surroundings, new sounds, and other strangers.
- Chihuahuas are often wary of strangers. When you show your Chihuahua to strangers, allow him to actively interact first - this will make him less afraid. [sixty-seven]
- When you get your Chihuahua to a baby, don't let him pet him or reward him first. Let the dog come to you and be comfortable with the baby first, then allow the dog to gently petting and reward the dog. [68]
- Foreign objects can also scare Chihuahuas. When familiarizing your Chihuahua with foreign objects, start by keeping enough distance away so the dog feels safe but still curious. Slowly move closer as it becomes more comfortable. [69]

## 6. Watch for Chihuahua's health issues

![Care-for-Your-Chihuahua-Step-21]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-chihuahua-dogs/v4-728px-Care-for-Your-Chihuahua-Step-21.jpg.webp)

### 6.1 Find out about patellar luxation. 

Chihuahuas, like many other breeds of dogs, are prone to many health problems. The patella, in which the patella is slipping out of position, is a common orthopedic problem in very small breeds. [70] Sometimes, the kneecap returns itself to its original position. However, severe cases need surgery to rearrange the kneecap. [71]
- A kneecap error can occur when a dog jumps up and down on indoor surfaces. [72] You should make a rule against Chihuahuas not to act like this.
- Symptoms of patellar luxation include: pain, limping, and “jumping like a rabbit” while running. [seventy-three]

![Care-for-Your-Chihuahua-Step-22]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-chihuahua-dogs/v4-728px-Care-for-Your-Chihuahua-Step-22.jpg.webp)

### 6.2 Chihuahua's mental illness awareness. 

Chihuahuas can develop a neurological disease called hydrocephalus, a birth defect in which cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the brain and puts pressure on the brain. [74] If you have hydrocephalus, your dog's head will swell. Hydrocephalus does not cure, but the pressure in the brain can be reduced with steroid medication and shunt surgery to drain fluid from the brain to the abdomen. [75]
- Open-air is another neurological problem in Chihuahua dogs. This occurs when the bones in the skull do not fully fuse. As a result, there is a soft spot on the top of the head. [76]
- Chihuahuas can live normally with open holes, but you must be extra careful when playing with them. Rough play increases the risk of a potentially fatal head injury for Chihuahuas with cleft palates. [77]

![Care-for-Your-Chihuahua-Step-23]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-chihuahua-dogs/v4-728px-Care-for-Your-Chihuahua-Step-23.jpg.webp)

### 6.3 Learn about the cardiovascular and respiratory diseases of Chihuahua. 

Chihuahuas can be prone to many heart and respiratory problems. For example, Chihuahuas may have a heart murmur, [78] that a veterinarian can diagnose. This condition can be varied, but can sometimes be improved through adjusting to eating and exercise habits. [79]
- Chihuahuas can suffer genetic damage to the trachea, in which the tracheal rings lose their firmness. [80] Conventional collars can cause tracheal damage in young dogs. [81]
- If your dog is tired or has difficulty breathing, it may have heart or breathing problems. You should take your dog to the veterinarian for a thorough examination.

![Care-for-Your-Chihuahua-Step-24]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-chihuahua-dogs/v4-728px-Care-for-Your-Chihuahua-Step-24.jpg.webp)

### 6.4 The heart understands hypoglycemia. 

Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, can be a problem in smaller breeds of dogs like Chihuahuas. Signs that your dog has hypoglycemia are slow-motion, lethargy, or trembling. [82] Severe hypoglycemia can lead to seizures, coma, and possibly death.
- If your Chihuahua has symptoms of hypoglycemia, you can rub honey under the tongue or on your dog's gums as a first-aid measure. [83]
- Take your Chihuahua to the veterinarian right away when your dog has low blood sugar.

> Advice
- Positive reinforcement (complimenting, rewarding food, more playtime) will help you train your Chihuahua more effectively. [84] Chihuahuas do not respond well to physical punishment or scolding.
- Chihuahuas do not tolerate cold very well. Wear a coat for your dog when taking him for a walk outdoors in cold weather. [85]
- Chihuahua can live up to 12-20 years, [86] a long time for you to develop a strong relationship with your dog.
