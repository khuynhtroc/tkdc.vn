> Guard dogs (or watchdogs) are trained to protect property and the host family. Contrary to what you may be thinking, most watchdogs are not taught to attack. [1] Instead, they are taught non-confrontational skills, such as guarding and barking to alert their owners when there is a stranger or a danger to their property. Training a guard dog is time consuming and requires patience, but the result will be a dog that not only protects you from threats, but also stays calm and docile in non-dangerous situations. dangerous.

## 1. Prepare to train your dog to be a guard dog

### 1.1 Know the difference between a guard dog and an attack dog. 

Guard dogs are trained to alert the owner of a stranger or intruder by barking or growling. Normally, guard dogs are not taught to attack on command or to act aggressive in front of strangers, so the guard dogs often cannot be good attack dogs. [2]
- Attack dogs are often used by police and law enforcement. They are trained to attack on command and respond vigorously to threats or intruders. [3]
- Most attacking dogs are well trained and will not react aggressively unless ordered by their owner. However, if not taught carefully, they can strike suddenly and are very dangerous for humans and other animals. [4]
- Normally, the average dog owner does not need a dog attack.

### 1.2 Determine if your dog is a guard dog. 

Most breeds of dogs can be trained as guard dogs, but some special breeds are capable of keeping a house well. Small breeds, such as the Chow Chow, the pug, and the Spratlys, are well known for being good guard dogs. [5] Larger breeds such as the Doberman Pinscher, German Shepherd and Akita may also be excellent guard dogs. [6]
- Some breeds, like the German Shepherd and the Doberman Pinscher, can be trained to be guard dogs as well as attack dogs. [7]
- If your dog is a purebred dog that is not a guard dog or a hybrid, you can still train it to be a good guard dog. If your dog has guard dog behavioral characteristics and is properly trained and has good communication, you can teach it to be your guard dog.

### 1.3 Learn about the properties of an ideal guard dog. 

Contrary to popular belief, a good guard dog does not react out of fear or out of an aggressive nature. In general, a good guard dog must be territorial, ready to protect its owner and property, but still know how to obey the master's orders. [8]
- A good guard dog must believe in himself and in his surroundings. A confident dog will be curious when it comes to meeting new people and environments, and is not shy about being afraid of strangers. [9] While this may be genetically inherited, proper exposure can also increase confidence in your dog.
- A good guard dog is also assertive. Assertiveness here doesn't have to be aggressive or overly aggressive; it's that your dog may not hesitate to move in a position that allows it to get what it wants. This also means that the dog must be confident in a new environment or a stranger instead of stepping away. [ten]
- Being sociable is another important guard dog trait. A dog with good communication skills will be able to recognize and be alert when a stranger appears in front of its owner, but will not attack or be too aggressive towards them. [11]
- A good guard dog should also be easy to train. [12] The Chow chow can be a good guard dog because it is naturally suspicious of strangers, but tends to be too independent and not easy to teach. [13]
- Loyal dogs can be very good guard dogs. The more loyal to you, the more enthusiastic the dog will protect you. The German shepherd is famous for being a loyal dog. [14]

### 1.4 Communicate with your dog when it is a child. 

Proper communication is essential in guard dog training. With good communication, your dog should be comfortable in its normal environment. The dog will also be less frightened and more relaxed - an important feature of a guard dog - but will maintain a moderate level of vigilance for unfamiliar situations and potential dangers. [15] The best time to teach a dog to communicate is when the puppy is 3-12 weeks old. [16]
- Outside of 12 weeks, your puppy will begin to be more alert in new situations, making it harder to communicate. [17]
- During communication, you need to train your puppy to be comfortable with strangers and to interact in new situations. This can be a huge task for your puppy, so it is easier to exercise it if you break it down into small chunks and expose your dog to situations at a level he is comfortable with. . [18]
- Reward your puppy with many positive reinforcement (petting, treats, extra playtime) every time it does well. [19]
- Puppy classes are a great place to practice your dog socializing. Remember that puppies need to stay up to date with their vaccinations and worming to stay healthy and avoid infection while on training. [20]
- If your dog is an adult and has been properly trained and communicated, it has the potential to be a good guard dog.

### 1.5 Make sure your dog obeys the basic commands. 

Before starting to train as a guard dog, your dog must be able to obey basic commands such as "saddle", "sit" and "lie down". The skill of following basic commands will help the dog begin to learn defense skills such as alert barking and guarding.
- You can teach your dog these commands yourself or sign up for command obedience training for your dog.

## 2. Train your dog to bark

![Train-a-Guard-Dog-Step-6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-train-guard-dogs/v4-728px-Train-a-Guard-Dog-Step-6-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Choose a word as a signal. 

To teach your dog to alert when a stranger comes to your house, first find a word as a signal. You can use the word "bark", but some people like to use a different word (such as "talk") to not show it clearly to those around you. [21] [22]
- When you choose the word "bark" as your signal, speak with the same enthusiasm every time you give the command.
- Use the same signal each time you give the dog a bark.

![Train-a-Guard-Dog-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-train-guard-dogs/v4-728px-Train-a-Guard-Dog-Step-7.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Practice with commands. 

Barking is a natural instinct for your dog, and you don't have to give bark commands when someone comes near or there is a sudden noise. The key here is to teach the dog to bark on command. To start, tie your dog to the base of the kitchen table or on a fence in the yard. Show your dog the treat, and step back and then get out of sight. [23]
- As soon as the dog makes a screeching or barking sound, run over to him and praise "good barking" or "good" [command]. " Immediately reward the dog. After repeated repetitions, your dog will begin to associate your compliment with the reward.
- Once your dog is used to the barking command in one area, take it to other parts of the yard and indoors. Test your dog's response to the command before taking him for a walk or a public outing.

![Train-a-Guard-Dog-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-train-guard-dogs/v4-728px-Train-a-Guard-Dog-Step-8.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Be firm and clear when giving orders. 

Consistency and practice are key to reinforcing this signal. If you want to test your dog's reaction while walking him, stop and look him in the eye. Then say the command "bark" in an enthusiastic voice. If your dog looks confused or hesitant at a signal, present the reward and repeat the command. [24]
- Ideally, the dog should bark every time you give a command. [25] However, it will likely continue barking once you give the order. Don't give your dog a treat if he continues to bark nonstop. Wait for it to silence and give the order again.

![Train-a-Guard-Dog-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-train-guard-dogs/v4-728px-Train-a-Guard-Dog-Step-9.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 Create a fantasy scenario. 

To challenge your dog's "barking" commands, leave the dog indoors and walk out the door. Once outside, ring the doorbell and say "bark". Reward your dog when he barks at your command. Next, knock on the door and give the order "bark". Give the dog a treat if it responds properly to the command. [26]
- If possible, do this script at night when there is no light outside. You will want your dog to alert you when someone arrives at your doorstep at night, so it's important to understand that it responds to a "bark" signal both during the day and at night. [27]
- Practice the command "to bark" in short bursts. After three to four repetitions, give your dog a break and do something else for about 45 minutes. After the break, you can practice the "bark" command more and more. The goal here is to avoid overtraining so that the dog won't get bored or irritable during the exercise. [28]

![Train-a-Guard-Dog-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-train-guard-dogs/v4-728px-Train-a-Guard-Dog-Step-10.jpg.webp)

### 2.5 Have a loved one test the dog's barking skills. 

When your dog seems accustomed to the "bark" command, focus on teaching the dog to bark at others. Ask a family member to step outside and knock on the door or ring the bell, at the same time stay indoors and give the dog a signal to bark. Reward your dog every time he barks. [29] This strengthens your dog's protective instincts by barking at an unfamiliar person (or something).
- Continue to practice the "bark" command with the help of a family member, rewarding the dog each time it barks when it hears a bell or knock on the door. Eventually your dog will begin to associate the sound of a bell or knocking on the door with the act of barking every time he hears those sounds.
- Over time, you will want to train your dog to bark at a bell or knock on the door instead of barking at your command.

## 3. Teach your dog the "silent" command.

![Train-a-Guard-Dog-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-train-guard-dogs/v4-728px-Train-a-Guard-Dog-Step-11.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Command your dog to bark. 

Your dog has learned to bark at signs, and now it's time to teach your dog to stop barking. In fact, teaching the dog the "bark" command is the first step in teaching the "silent" command. [30] The ability to bark and stop barking will make your dog a good guard dog.
- As always, reward your dog when it responds properly to your "bark" command.

![Train-a-Guard-Dog-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-train-guard-dogs/v4-728px-Train-a-Guard-Dog-Step-12.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Command your dog to stop barking. 

Rang the doorbell. When your dog barks at the bell, hold a treats treat in front of his nose. As soon as the dog stops barking to sniff the treat, say "thank you" or "hush." Reward your dog immediately after giving a verbal command. [thirty first]
- Do not yell or shout when giving orders. A loud voice can make the dog more alert and bark more. [32]
- Don't use the word "shut up" or "no" to command your dog to shut up, as these have negative meanings.

![Train-a-Guard-Dog-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-train-guard-dogs/v4-728px-Train-a-Guard-Dog-Step-13.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Practice alternating between the command "bark" and "silence". 

Alternating training between the two commands will help you control your dog's barking behavior, and this is very important in training your dog to be a good guard dog. You can have fun by varying the number of "bark" commands before you give "silent" commands. Perhaps the dog will see this as a game, and as such the training sessions will become much more enjoyable for both parties. [33]

![Train-a-Guard-Dog-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-train-guard-dogs/v4-728px-Train-a-Guard-Dog-Step-14.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Encourage your dog to bark whenever a stranger comes. 

Encourage your dog to bark every time the doorbell rings, even if you already know who's outside. The dog may not know who is on the other side of the door, so encourage his protective instincts and alert you to an unfamiliar phenomenon. As you approach the door, say "shut up" and immediately reward the dog when it stops barking. [34]
- Do not encourage your dog to bark when you meet a friendly stranger or take your dog out for a walk. [35]

![Train-a-Guard-Dog-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-train-guard-dogs/v4-728px-Train-a-Guard-Dog-Step-15.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Practice the "silence" command over and over again. 

As with any other training, repetition is essential to teaching your dog to respond correctly every time you give a command. Practice this command in short bursts and reward your dog every time he does it right.

> Advice
- If you want to turn a guard dog into an attack dog, give your dog professional training. It is best to let the experts teach your dog attack techniques; you don't want to be mis-trained and as a result your dog becomes overly aggressive. [36] You can find a professional dog trainer online, or ask a veterinarian for referrals.
- Put a "watch out for bad dogs" sign in your yard to prevent strangers or intruders. Make sure the warning sign is loud enough for passers-by to see clearly.
- A good way of training to increase your dog's resilience and communication ability is to stuff your dog's food into plastic eggs so that your dog and other dogs run to find and get the food inside.
