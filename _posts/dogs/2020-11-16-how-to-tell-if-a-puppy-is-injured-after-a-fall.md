Dogs seem to be quite agile, but when they fall they can seriously hurt like other animals. There are dogs getting excited and jumping out a window from a high floor or from a glass window while cars are in motion. Knowing how to evaluate the condition and re-inform the veterinarian can be very helpful in helping the dog to receive proper care after a fall.

## 1. Evaluate your dog's condition after a fall

### 1.1 Keep calm. 

It can be quite frightening to see your dog fall, but try to stay calm so that you can best assess the dog's condition and also calm him down. This will prevent the dog from becoming more stressed and injured. [first]
- If your dog finds you frightened, he will also be more frightened, hurt, and more stressed.

### 1.2 Look for signs of injury. 

After your dog has fallen, calmly check if you can see any wounds. You should only check with your eyes and do not touch the dog. Checking the level of your injury will help you figure out what to do next. Watch for the following signs of injury: [2] [3]
- A dog chirping is an obvious sign of pain.
- Check for external injuries, such as cuts, scrapes, or protruding bones.
- Examine the dog's fore and hind legs. If the dog has broken bones, the dog's legs will look deformed, bent, or have an unusual posture.
- Sometimes the signs of a fracture cannot be seen with the naked eye. If your dog is limping for longer than 5 minutes then you should take it to the vet.
- When injured, your dog will breathe faster than usual. Watch for signs of prolonged increased breathing in your dog.
- Not all wounds can be observed. Only a veterinarian can determine if the dog has an internal injury.
- Observe the gums. Pale or white gums are an indication of shock or internal bleeding. This is very dangerous and you need to see a veterinarian immediately.

### 1.3 Give first aid. 

If you observe that your dog is injured, you can do first aid to prevent the injury from getting worse while taking it to the vet. Be sure to only give first aid when the dog is comfortable with it. Pain and stress can cause your dog to growl or even bite you, so act slowly and watch for its response. [4]
- If the dog is unable to move, lay it on a sturdy, flat board or object before lifting it.
- Do not arbitrarily treat serious injuries. You should let your veterinarian do this.
- Wash shallow wounds or cuts with salt water.
- Use a clean gauze to apply pressure to bleeding areas to stop bleeding.

### 1.4 Contact and take the dog to the vet. 

After assessing the condition and giving first aid to your dog, you need to contact and take him to the vet. Your veterinarian will best evaluate and treat your dog's wounds. [5]
- If your dog is seriously injured, take him to the vet for immediate emergency.
- Get the dog to the veterinarian as soon as possible, although the wound is not life-threatening.
- Even if you can't see any signs of injury, your veterinarian will help check if it has any internal injuries or hard-to-see wounds.

### 2.1 Notify veterinarian about the accident. 

When you visit your veterinarian, you will need to provide accurate information about your dog's injury so that he or she can treat it more quickly and effectively.
- Tell your doctor exactly when and how your dog fell.
- Inform your doctor of any signs of injury you are observing.
- What first aid operations did you take.
- Tell the doctor any history of the dog's injury or surgery, if any.
- Be prepared to provide basic information about the dog, including age, medications and other health issues.

### 2.2 Note some of the exams your veterinarian will likely do. 

Your veterinarian will probably do some diagnostic tests and some medical techniques to treat the dog's wound. You can refer to some examination and treatment steps below. [6] [7]
- A preliminary physical examination will help the doctor understand the external wounds and general condition of the dog.
- Check your dog's motor system for bone, joint, muscle injuries, or motor problems; This step may include x-rays.
- Check the nervous system if the dog has been hit on the head when falling. If the dog is moving abnormally or seems to have lost consciousness, this test will help determine if its nervous system is damaged.

### 2.3 Follow your doctor's directions. 

Once your dog is rescued and has settled to go home, your doctor will instruct you on how to care for it at home. You need to follow these instructions exactly to make sure the dog will make a full recovery quickly. [8] [9]
- If your dog needs to take medicine, give him the right time and the right dose, making sure he finishes the medicine.
- Change your dog's bandage as often as needed.
- You may need a cold compress or a hot compress on the wound.
- Make sure the dog is rested and kept its activities to a minimum as the wound is healing.

### 3.1 Close the car window. 

If your dog loves to walk in the car with you, don't forget this simple step to keep him safe. Most of us wouldn't be able to jump out of a moving car, but dogs wouldn't be that hesitant. So don't forget to close the windows while driving so they can't jump out. [ten]
- You can also buy a dog seat belt for safety while riding.
- Turn off automatic door opening to prevent the dog from accidentally opening the door.
- Do not leave your dog in a closed car on hot days. The temperature in the car can rise to the point where it is fatal.[11]

### 3.2 Close windows indoors. 

The most common risk for dogs to fall is from open windows that they can climb. Even if the windows are blind, your dog will probably try to get out and face the risk of falling. So close or close all the indoor windows that the dog can reach enough that he can't get out. [twelfth]

### 3.3 Watch out for your dog to fall indoors. 

You should keep your dog away from dangerous, fall-prone areas indoors to ensure its safety.
- For example, some areas where dogs are susceptible to falling indoors include steep stairs, loft without balustrades, and balconies.
- Make sure doors to these areas are closed at all times.
- You can purchase a pet door that blocks your way up stairs or entrances to your home.
- Do not take your dog to fall prone areas indoors.

### 3.4 Get your dog to the vet if he falls down without cause. 

If you notice that your dog is tripping and falling for no apparent reason, take it to the vet as soon as possible. That could be a sign that the dog is sick, and the veterinarian will help diagnose and provide appropriate treatment. [13]
- Problems inside the ear or ear infections can cause your dog to fall.
- Brain tumors, a common problem in older dogs, can also cause your dog to fall.

> Advice
- Stay calm and carefully examine your dog after a fall.
- Give your veterinarian all the details about falls and injuries you observed.
- Follow your doctor's instructions when caring for your dog at home.

> Warning
- Do not assume that the dog will still wag his tail after falling. A dog often does not show clearly that it is in pain or injury.
- When in pain your dog will bite you easily, even if you own it, so be careful.
- When a dog falls, take it to the vet promptly.
