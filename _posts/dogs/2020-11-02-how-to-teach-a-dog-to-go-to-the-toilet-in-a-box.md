Imagine being late from work and not having to worry about taking your dog to the toilet. Or you live in an apartment building and don't need to take your dog outside every time he needs to pee. Teaching your dog to defecate in a box can be convenient for both you and your dog. To do this, you will need the right equipment, familiarize your dog with the box, and teach your dog how to use it.

## 1. Prepare a litter box

### 1.1 Buy a large plastic tray to make a toilet box. 

All you need is a waste container, though there are many more expensive appliances that offer the same cleaning functionality or have grass on top (with waste tray below). [first]
- The box should be large enough to allow the dog to rotate inside.
- The edges should be low enough for the dog to get in, but also high enough to prevent the dog from peeing out of the box if he raises his legs.
- If you're buying a can with a hood, consider cutting out the top to make it easier for the dog to use and easier to clean. [2]

### 1.2 Put the sand in the box. 

Dog sand is most effective because it has larger pellets for better absorption. Sand for a wide variety, from ordinary clay to activated carbon helps control odors. To control odors, simply sprinkle baking soda on the bottom before adding the sand each time. [3]

### 1.3 Buy shovels and trash cans. 

Make sure to remove the dog's waste every time it defecates in the box, if possible. Having a shovel and trash can nearby will make this easier. [4]

### 1.4 Place the box in a convenient, yet private place. 

Make sure to place the box close to the places where the dog is most frequented, but far enough away that you won't see it.
- Do not place the can near your dog's food and drink, as the dog will not defecate where it eats.
- Be aware of your dog's tendency to dig into his box, especially at first. Place the box in a place where the waste will not contaminate too much. [5]

### 1.5 Make sure each dog and cat has a separate litter box. 

The cat needs to feel in control of its box, or it will begin to pee outside of the box to mark its territory. And if you have two dogs, it is best to give each one a separate box to avoid the same territorial problem. [6]

## 2. Introduce the dog to the box

![Litter-Train-a-Dog-Step-6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-go-to-the-toilet-in-a-box/v4-728px-Litter-Train-a-Dog-Step-6.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Teach your dog to enter the box with the first command. 

Before a puppy or adult dog defecates in the box, it will need to be able to step into its box. You need to teach it that the box is safe, even fun. [7]

![Litter-Train-a-Dog-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-go-to-the-toilet-in-a-box/v4-728px-Litter-Train-a-Dog-Step-7.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Put the dog in the box and give commands like "use the box". 

Praise when the dog is in the box.

![Litter-Train-a-Dog-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-go-to-the-toilet-in-a-box/v4-728px-Litter-Train-a-Dog-Step-8.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Wait for the dog to come out and put it back on. 

Repeat the command, and again, compliment the dog and behave happily that the dog is in the box. Continue practicing until you can guide the dog into the box while giving the command "use the can".

### 2.4 Have the dog enter the box with only the command "use the box". 

Once the dog is used to being directed to the box, try giving only commands. Be patient and don't make mistakes. If the dog doesn't come in, just go away and try again next time, or go back to the instructions. If the dog comes in on a command, praise him very much. Continue to practice until the dog has entered at the immediate command.

## 3. Teach your dog to use a box

![Litter-Train-a-Dog-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-go-to-the-toilet-in-a-box/v4-728px-Litter-Train-a-Dog-Step-10.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Be optimistic and patient. 

Punishing a dog when he pee or poop out of the litter box will only scare him and make it harder to teach. Patience is the best way to train a dog.

![Litter-Train-a-Dog-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-go-to-the-toilet-in-a-box/v4-728px-Litter-Train-a-Dog-Step-11.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Blot a little bit of urine into newspaper or put some of the dog's waste from the outside into the box. 

This will show your dog that he is defecating there and will make him more likely to do so. [8]

![Litter-Train-a-Dog-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-go-to-the-toilet-in-a-box/v4-728px-Litter-Train-a-Dog-Step-12.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Feed your dog at regular intervals. 

Eliminate food between meals. Feeding your dog regularly will cause him to go to the bathroom a lot. [9]

![Litter-Train-a-Dog-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-go-to-the-toilet-in-a-box/v4-728px-Litter-Train-a-Dog-Step-13.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Watch for signs when an adult dog needs to poop. 

Whining, running back and forth, sniffing around the house, or going to the door are all signs that your dog needs to poop. Take the dog to the litter box immediately.

![Litter-Train-a-Dog-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-go-to-the-toilet-in-a-box/v4-728px-Litter-Train-a-Dog-Step-14.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Send the puppy to the box with the fixed timetable "use the box" command to avoid problems. [10] 

Puppies should have a litter box every hour, as well as after meals and bedtime. All puppies should be pooped first thing in the morning, just before you go to bed, and before they are locked up or left alone.[11]
- Puppies can suppress urination during the day for the same number of hours for many months of age.
- Puppies can hold urine longer at night. A 4-month-old dog can hold pee all night

### 3.6 Keep an eye on your dog to avoid malfunction. 

You don't want your dog in the habit of defecating indoors, so whenever your dog is not chained, keep an eye on it often. Running back and forth, moaning, turning, sniffling, and leaving the room are all signs that your dog needs to pee or poop. Take the dog to the litter box as quickly as possible.[twelfth]

![Litter-Train-a-Dog-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-go-to-the-toilet-in-a-box/v4-728px-Litter-Train-a-Dog-Step-16.jpg.webp)

### 3.7 Lock up your dog when you cannot track it. 

Use a small room to lock the door or block it with a door for the baby. Place the litter box in the room so the dog can use it when needed. [13]

![Litter-Train-a-Dog-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-go-to-the-toilet-in-a-box/v4-728px-Litter-Train-a-Dog-Step-17.jpg.webp)

### 3.8 Reward your dog with pee or poop in the litter box. 

While teaching your dog to go to the bathroom, make sure you go to the litter box with your dog regularly. Reward your dog in the correct toilet spot by rewarding, praising, or playing with the dog.[14]

![Litter-Train-a-Dog-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-go-to-the-toilet-in-a-box/v4-728px-Litter-Train-a-Dog-Step-18.jpg.webp)

### 3.9 Clean the box every time the dog goes to the toilet. 

Dogs will not bury feces like cats do. You will need to scoop it out every time your dog poop. At least once a month, pour everything away and wash it off. The dog will not use it if the box is too dirty. [15]

![Litter-Train-a-Dog-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-go-to-the-toilet-in-a-box/v4-728px-Litter-Train-a-Dog-Step-19.jpg.webp)

### 3.10 Stay calm if you find your dog is defecating in the wrong place. 

You will not want to scare him, and even less want to put his face in that mess. Clap your hands loudly to startle the dog; This usually causes the dog to stop. Then quickly bring the dog to the litter box, encouraging it to follow you. If your dog pooped or pooped in the box, reward it. If your dog doesn't go to the bathroom, don't worry about it.[16]

> Warning
- The litter box is a great way for your dog to poop when you can't take it outside, but it's not a substitute for getting out. You will still need to give your dog a chance to defecate outside. [17]
- Canning dog training works best for younger dogs, as taller dogs will often raise their legs and pee. [18]
