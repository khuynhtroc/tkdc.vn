### 3.1 Give your dog some human food to keep him happy. 

If your picky eater is unable to get rid of the human food habit, you can add a small amount of meat broth (warm water) or a teaspoon of pureed banana or pumpkin to dry food. You can also add extra whole cheese or some hard-boiled eggs. Just remember that human food should make up no more than 10% of your dog's total food intake. [6]

### 3.2 Do not give your dog treats. 

While it's time to switch to dry food, don't give your dog treats. You should also only feed your dog 2 times a day until he is able to eat dry food regularly. After the dog eats dry food regularly, you can re-feed the dog, but absolutely do not feed the dog human food because it can recur the "disease" picky eating again.

### 3.3 Set a time limit when you feed your dog. 

Timing your dog's meals regularly and getting back food when the time is up will encourage your dog to eat every time you provide the food. It is a great way to leave dog food at the right time each day, then give it 15 minutes to eat. After the 15 minute period, you can get your food back and remove any leftovers. Then, continue to feed the dog after 12 hours and do the same thing above. Do not give your dog any food between meals. [8]
- If your dog still refuses to eat after 2 days, you can give him some familiar food (1/2 normal amount of food). Then, try the above again. You can also mix dry food with a little bit of human food (no more than 10%) to encourage your dog to eat. [9]

### 3.4 Try hand feeding. 

You can also try hand-feeding the dog. Sit next to the dog and keep some crushed dry food on hand. Then, hold it in front of the dog to see if it will eat it. If you are used to feeding human food, your dog can also accept dry food from your hands.

> Advice

- You may have to try several dry food brands to find the one your dog likes. Buy a small bag to save in case the dog doesn't like it.
- If your dog bothers you or beg for food every time you eat, take it to another room. DO NOT give food every time the dog begs.

> Warning
- Slowly change. Sudden changes can upset your stomach and lead to vomiting and / or diarrhea.
- If your dog is suddenly a fussy eater and this continues for more than 2 days, you should see the vet in case he gets sick.
