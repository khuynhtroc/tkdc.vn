> When a dog licks you, it means that it is expressing feelings or showing submission to you, indicating that it respects you as its owner. [1] Being licked by a dog from time to time is not a problem, but is even lovable. But if the dog licks you or your guests too much, in turn this can quickly lead to discomfort. What's more, too much licking is often a sign of an anxiety disorder in a dog, and should be addressed for the dog's benefit, as well as for yourself. Learning to stop your dog's habit of licking people can help you determine if it's simply an expression of your dog's emotions or a sign of a more serious illness.

## 1. Prevent your dog from licking

### 1.1 Ignore your dog when he licks you. 

If your dog licks you to get attention or show emotion, your retaliation can help stop the behavior.
- Do not be grumpy at the dog. Even to an unpleasant reaction from the owner, in the dog's thought, the response is also a relentless act of licking.
- Stop what you are doing, get up and leave the room when the dog licks you for too long. This will help reinforce the dog's thinking that his licking will not get the desired results. [2]

### 1.2 Use medicine. 

Pheromones, also known as DAP, have been shown to be effective in treating the obsessive behaviors that often accompany anxiety disorders in dogs. [3] This chemical regenerates the pheromones found in nursing puppies, which can reduce anxiety or fear in dogs. [4]

### 1.3 Change the type of soap or lotion you are using. 

Chances are your dog licked you because he liked the scent or the smell he smelled on you. Try using an unscented soap or lotion, then see if the dog reduces lick again.

### 1.4 Use topical products made of citrus fruits (oranges, lemons, grapefruits). 

Despite the exceptions, most dogs dislike the scent and taste of citrus fruits. Using topical products made from citrus fruits, or even gently rubbing the peels of these fruits on your skin, can also prevent your dog from licking you. [5]

### 1.5 Keep your dog busy with the toys. 

Burning can help prevent dog's negative behavior, so many toys, including homemade ones to challenge the dog's mind, can prevent undesirable behavior like lick excessively. [6]

### 1.6 Consider medication. 

If your dog's licking is a sign of a severe anxiety disorder, you may need to consult your veterinarian about prescribing medication for your pet.
- Clomipramine is often indicated for use in pets with anxiety disorders. These medications help treat behaviors caused by animal phobias such as licking people. [7]
- The drug fluoxetine is also another popular drug indicated in animals with anxiety disorders. This drug specializes in dog disorders and comes with some side effects. [8]

## 2. Train your dog to stop licking

### 2.1 Strengthen alternative behaviors. 

One way to curb obsessive behavior like licking is to replace it with another, contrasting behavior. The contrasting behavior in this case could be anything that involves the dog's mouth activity so that it cannot lick you.
- Have your dog play catch as soon as it starts licking you. This will distract your dog from the anxiety, the cause of the lick, and you will make it physically difficult for the dog to want to lick you while playing with toys. [9]
- Try taking the dog for a walk whenever it licks you. This can lead to your dog licking you every time he wants to go out to play, and can also reduce obsessive behaviors toward your pet.

### 2.2 Get your dog to do more exercise. 

A vigorous exercise can tire the dog, reduce stress and even reduce interest in licking you. [ten]

### 2.3 Reward your dog for his positive actions. 

If your dog licks it just to get your attention, give it attention. Rewarding for good behavior should be initiated immediately after the dog has acted properly, so that the dog understands that his actions have been praised by you. Rewarding the dog in this situation will teach them to calm down, and "normal" behaviors are well liked. [11]

### 2.4 Teach your dog to lick as required. 

This helps teach your dog that licks are acceptable only when you ask them to. [twelfth]
- Choose a word to teach your dog to lick. The word could be "lick", "fragrant", or any other word you want your dog to associate with licking.
- Reach out while saying the required word you have chosen. You can use a little peanut butter on your hands to prompt the dog to lick your hand during the first few exercises. However, this should only be done if you are sure that the dog will not become aggressive when it comes to food.
- Use a stop command, such as "stop", or "stop". Wait to see if the dog automatically responds to your request. If the dog stops licking, even after a few seconds, reward it. But if not, repeat the request and withdraw your hand.
- Praise your dog for licking, and stop at your request. Praising good behavior is a deciding factor in training your dog to respond to your request.

### 2.5 Be consistent in action. 

If you want your dog to stop licking, force it to stop it altogether. You can't praise him when he licks you today but scold him for doing the same thing the next day. This will confuse the dog and not understand what you want. Remember, any training takes patience and consistency. [13]

- Keep your dog busy with other things and don't get too close to its mouth.
