summary: It's not fun seeing the best friends get sick. They depend on the care of you, whoever they are sick. The first step is to recognize when your dog is sick, followed by determining the severity of the illness. Some sicknesses can be taken care of at home, others need immediate supervision by a veterinarian. Anytime you're not sure, don't hesitate to call your doctor for advice.

> Breeding a dog is fun and enjoyable as long as you understand the responsibilities and risks of the process. Having a pack of puppies running around in the house looks cute and fun, but it takes a lot of work! If you are interested in breeding dogs, you need to make sure you are ready for the job.

## 1. Decide to breed a dog

![Breed-Dogs-Step-1]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-breed-dogs/v4-728px-Breed-Dogs-Step-1-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.1 Take it easy to learn. 

To see if you are ready and fit to breed dogs, you first need to do some research. The research will help you see how this process works and what needs to be done. Read books written by reputable breeders or veterinarians. Discuss with your veterinarian about the benefits and disadvantages. Talk to reputable breeders about dog breeding practices.
- Find and buy books written by a veterinarian. Consider titles such as Canine Reproduction: Breeders' Handbook, 3rd edition by TS. Phyllis A. Holst, or Whole Dog Breeding by TS. Dan Rice.

### 1.2 There is a good reason. 

The only reliable reason to breed a dog depends on the experience and information you have researched before. If you have spent two or more years of training and working with dogs, you are the right person to breed dogs. In order to bring quality, healthy puppies to this world, you need work and research.
- You should not breed dogs for sale as pets. Dog breeding is not a good way of profit or responsible employment. This will create a market that will promote the flourishing of dog breeding facilities around the world. Take responsibility and don't be a contributor to pet overcrowding.
- Proper and responsible dog breeding takes a lot of time and investment.

![Breed-Dogs-Step-3]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-breed-dogs/v4-728px-Breed-Dogs-Step-3-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.3 Consider your eligibility. 

Make sure you have an excellent dog compared to others in your breed, or you can ask a dog quality assessment specialist. You should improve that breed, meaning that you need proof that your dog is in the top 10% of the particular breed. In general, your dog should make a positive contribution to genetic resources.
- Dogs should be healthy and alert. Your dog's appearance must be in balance and meet the breed standards. Your dog's temper should be exceptionally good too.
- You need to be prepared to live with your puppies for a minimum of 8 weeks before they arrive in your new home. You need to know what time of the year mating can take place. This will help you understand how breeding affects you and your family.
- Prepare to take care of all puppies. You are responsible for their health and well-being. If for some reason you cannot find a new home for all of them, you will have to raise them yourself.

### 1.4 Know which breeds of dogs are suitable for breeding. 

There are several breeds of dogs that are good candidates for breeding. They have valuable genetic traits to pass on to future generations. You can breed sniffing dogs, they are able to herd and drive livestock to the barn, or track prey. You can also breed show dogs, which are judged on appearance and behavior.
- For sniffing dogs, the skills to do these jobs well tend to pass on to the next generation. Dad and mother dogs need a track record that is recorded in the field. People often hold competitions to prove whether a dog can do a good job.
- The performing dog needs to have a good physique. That is the standard of appearance for each breed. Each breed has a standard set by the American Breed Dog Club. Dogs are bred to meet these criteria and are scored on the catwalk with other dogs to determine which one best fits the criteria.
- Other countries have their own breeding standards. If you plan to perform in other countries then find your fitness standards there.

## 2. Choose dogs to breed

![Breed-Dogs-Step-5]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-breed-dogs/v4-728px-Breed-Dogs-Step-5-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Choose a dog. 

You need to choose a breed from your dog. That means you need to choose a fertile female, and a male dog to mate with a female dog. Make sure they have the characteristics discussed.
- You can also find male dogs from another breeder if you don't have one. Renting a male dog or buying sperm costs money. Sometimes the contract allows the male dog owner to take the puppies. Ensure that all agreements are in writing and signed so that there is a contract between the parties involved in the puppy.

![Breed-Dogs-Step-6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-breed-dogs/v4-728px-Breed-Dogs-Step-6-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Determine your dog's genes. 

You should learn about the genetic resources of the breed dog. Check your dog's bloodline to make sure they have good bloodline properties. For purebred dogs, you can obtain a bloodline profile from the American Dog Club or another registry. You also need to make sure the breed does not have a direct bloodline to prevent genetic defects caused by inbreeding.
- You should test your dog and the dog you intend to mate with to look for genetic problems related to its breed. The American Orthopedic Foundation (OFA) manages a database of dogs and test results for genetic diseases such as hip and elbow dysplasia, eye disease, patella, and heart problems. You should not breed dogs with diseases that can be passed on to the next generation.

![Breed-Dogs-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-breed-dogs/v4-728px-Breed-Dogs-Step-7-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Keep track of their temperament. 

Observe the breed of dogs to assess their behavior. Consider their behavior when interacting with each other and with other dogs. Breeding friendly, well-mannered dogs will often produce puppies with a similar temperament. Aggressive and terrifying ones should not be bred as they are so dangerous. 

![Breed-Dogs-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-breed-dogs/v4-728px-Breed-Dogs-Step-8-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 Check your dog's age. 

Make sure your dog is of reproductive age. Breeding dogs are usually around 2 years old. Many genetic problems will appear before the dog is 24 months old. You can screen for these problems in a specific test. For example, OFA will not accept X-rays of dogs under 24 months of age to evaluate and classify hip dysplasia. For breeding to be successful, the parent dog needs a permanent electronic microchip or tattoo to be able to send test data to OFA and other organizations. They want to make sure there's no way to falsify the results. 
- Females begin to be in heat between 6 and 9 months of age. They are in heat every 5-11 months after the first estrus. A breeder usually doesn't breed a bitch until she is 2 years old and has gone through 3 or 4 periods of heat. This is the time when the bitch is fully mature. Their physical strength is now ready to withstand the pressure of pregnancy and childbirth.

## 3. Health check for dogs

![Breed-Dogs-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-breed-dogs/v4-728px-Breed-Dogs-Step-9-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Take your dog to the vet. 

Before mating, you need to bring your dog to the vet for a checkup, and make sure it has been vaccinated. The antibodies in the mother dog will be passed on to the puppies when they suckle. Antibodies will protect the puppy from getting sick.

![Breed-Dogs-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-breed-dogs/v4-728px-Breed-Dogs-Step-10-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Know your dog's medical history. 

If your dog has potential medical problems it could alter your breeding plan. Small dogs may have genetic problems that you should know about before mating. Puppies are more likely to have the same or worse problems. It can be a tooth problem like the teeth coming out of the wrong position, leading to a condition where the upper and lower jaws don't touch each other. They can be prone to dislocations of the kneecap, hip or elbow dysplasia, and spinal problems such as a torn disc. Dogs can also have allergies leading to skin and ear infections, heart problems, eye problems, or behavior problems. 
- Make sure your dog has been dewormed periodically. Nematodes, hookworms, and worms can only be passed from the mother to the puppies. 

![Breed-Dogs-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-breed-dogs/v4-728px-Breed-Dogs-Step-11-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Reproductive health check. 

You will need to check your dog's health to make sure it can reproduce. In male dogs, they can analyze the sperm. These tests, for example, find genetic problems as well as infectious diseases such as Brucellosis. Before mating a female dog or a male dog, a Brucellosis test is recommended to make sure no one carries the germ and spreads it to the other.

## 4. Begin the mating process

![Breed-Dogs-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-breed-dogs/v4-728px-Breed-Dogs-Step-12-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Wait for the bitch to come to heat. 

Female dogs need to go into heat before being mated. This time is not fixed, so you will have to watch to know when the bitch is in heat. Then the bitch's genitals begin to swell and get bloody. If the male dog is nearby he will be very excited.
- A female dog will not accept a male dog until it is ready to mate. It may even bite a male dog to chase it away if he is not ready. Don't let them get hurt. Please watch carefully when pairing two children together.
- Usually, the female dog will accept the male dog 9-11 days after the estrus, and allow the male to climb to mate.
- If you're having trouble getting your bitch to mate, get your vet to get tested for Progesterone. This test will show when the heat cycle starts and your dog's body is ready to receive the semen. Progesterone levels will rise 1-2 days before ovulation. Some female dogs have a quiet oestrus cycle that is undetectable, and a Progesterone test will help determine the time of ovulation.

![Breed-Dogs-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-breed-dogs/v4-728px-Breed-Dogs-Step-13-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.2 Consider artificial insemination. 

Artificial insemination can help you breed your dog if you don't have a male dog. Dog semen frozen in liquid nitrogen can be transported around the world. They will take steps to thaw and fertilize the bitch. You may have to consider this if the dog pair you choose doesn't seem to be able to mate naturally.
- This is quite troublesome because of potential problems with the reproductive health of the next generation of dogs are questioned.
- In special cases, semen may be implanted by a veterinarian in a bitch's womb once it has been anesthetized. Of course, these tips will increase the cost of each pregnancy and each puppy.

![Breed-Dogs-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-breed-dogs/v4-728px-Breed-Dogs-Step-14-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.3 Keep the bitch healthy. 

Once you are sure that the female dog has been bred, you can separate it from the male. You need to provide a balanced diet for the mother dog, can supplement vitamins and calcium. The veterinarian will often recommend this.
- You need to maintain this nutrition throughout your dog's pregnancy. The gestation period of a dog is about 58-68 days.
- Keep the kennel clean, free of parasites like fleas. Clean the barn periodically and provide plenty of drinking water and clean liners.

![Breed-Dogs-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-breed-dogs/v4-728px-Breed-Dogs-Step-15-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.4 Notice any changes in the bitch. 

The nipples and mammary glands undergo changes during pregnancy. Towards the end of pregnancy, the mammary glands begin to produce milk. During the last three weeks of pregnancy, bitches need more nutrition. Consult with your veterinarian for advice on the right nutrition.
- Usually, the pregnant female dog is fed puppy food for the last three weeks of her pregnancy. Puppy food provides enough calories and nutrients for the developing fetus and prepares the puppies for breastfeeding.

## 5. Prepare your dog to give birth

![Breed-Dogs-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-breed-dogs/v4-728px-Breed-Dogs-Step-16-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 5.1 Prepare the nest. 

Birthplace is a place for the mother dog to give birth. You should use a box about 15cm longer than the mother dog when it is lying on its stomach, and about 30 cm wider. The box should have rails to prevent the mother from resting on her puppies after giving birth.
- Alternating layers of plastic cloth and newspaper at the bottom of the box. This liner keeps the nest box cleaner when the bottom of the box becomes dirty. Simply pull out a layer of paper and a plastic cloth and let the rest clean. Add a clean towel or other liners that can be washed easily.

![Breed-Dogs-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-breed-dogs/v4-728px-Breed-Dogs-Step-17-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 5.2 Please note. 

You need to pay attention to know when your dog is about to give birth and learn about the stages of labor. When the mother starts to go into labor, watch it for signs of strong contractions that last longer than 30-45 minutes but still cannot deliver. This can be a complication during labor.
- X-rays taken on day 45 of pregnancy will help the doctor count how many puppy bones are in the womb. The x-ray also shows if there are unusually large puppies that could be causing birth problems. This information is the basis for you and your veterinarian to prepare for the possibility of a cesarean section and knows in advance how many puppies will be born.

![Breed-Dogs-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-breed-dogs/v4-728px-Breed-Dogs-Step-18-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 5.3 Keep the puppies warm. 

You need to keep your newborn puppies warm and make sure all puppies can breastfeed. Check for birth defects like cleft palate. The palate of the puppy should be perfect, with no signs of cleavage of the oral tissue. The mother dog will clean the puppies and help them get into the suckling position.
- If the puppy has a cleft palate, the milk will flow from the mouth into the nasal passages. If this disability is severe then you should be safe for it because it will not be able to live.

![Breed-Dogs-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-breed-dogs/v4-728px-Breed-Dogs-Step-19-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 5.4 Record fertility data. 

Record the date of birth, the total number of puppies, and the number of females and males. If you are planning on registering these puppies with an organization like AKC, you can do so online. You will need the paternity and dog's registration number to fill out the application form.

## 6. Take care of your puppy

![Breed-Dogs-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-breed-dogs/v4-728px-Breed-Dogs-Step-20-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 6.1 Follow the puppy. 

Watch the puppies carefully for the first few weeks, making sure they are clean and warm and are well fed. Weigh the puppies daily (scale with a scale) to ensure that the dog is gaining evenly. A healthy puppy should be completely clean, active, and have a tight stomach. Puppies should gain about 10% of their body weight each day for the first 2 weeks.
- Around 4 weeks old, the dog becomes very active. The spawning nest will no longer be large enough for them, so provide a larger box with a wall around it for safety. The mother will usually be away from the nest for a longer time, and you can start weaning the puppies with water-soaked pellets. 

![Breed-Dogs-Step-21]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-breed-dogs/v4-728px-Breed-Dogs-Step-21.jpg.webp)

### 6.2 Take your dog to the vet. 

Take the puppies to the vet when they are 7-8 weeks old. The veterinarian will give them the first vaccination. They will be vaccinated against Distemper, hepatitis, Parvo, and disease caused by the sub-influenza virus (Parainfluenza) or DHPP. Puppies are also treated for worms. Talk with your doctor about preventing fleas and filariasis.
- Ask the vet to check for other health and genetic issues. The responsible breeder will make this information available to new owners of the dog so that they can complete subsequent vaccinations within the recommended time frame.

![Breed-Dogs-Step-22]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-breed-dogs/v4-728px-Breed-Dogs-Step-22.jpg.webp)

### 6.3 Check the dog's new owner. 

This process should be done carefully. You should only sell your dog to a family that can provide a good habitat for it. The new owner should be a responsible person, willing to spend time, effort, and money on a newly purchased dog.
- Consider inspecting the new owner's home. Be willing to refuse if they are not suitable for puppies.

![Breed-Dogs-Step-23]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-breed-dogs/v4-728px-Breed-Dogs-Step-23.jpg.webp)

### 6.4 Contracting. 

After you find a suitable new owner, you should sign a contract with them. Be sure to mention the health warranties and the limits of them. You also need to make it a rule that they must return the puppies if they cannot continue at any time in the dog's life cycle.
-In addition, you should determine whether the puppies are sold as pets or for later reproductive purposes, and whether or not to require ovarian removal/castration when the dog reaches a certain age.
