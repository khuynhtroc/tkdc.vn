## 3. Cleaning the Dog

![Take-Care-of-a-Dog-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-take-care-of-dogs/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Dog-Step-11-Version-2.jpg.webp)

![Take-Care-of-a-Dog-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-take-care-of-dogs/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Dog-Step-13-Version-2.jpg.webp)

This is usually not easy, but you need to keep their feet healthy. Cut slowly and evenly, making sure not to cut into the nail marrow. Truncating the nail marrow will injure the dog and cause them to resist fiercely the next time you cut their nails.

![Take-Care-of-a-Dog-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-take-care-of-dogs/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Dog-Step-14-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Give your dog lots of training opportunities. 

You should schedule the amount of active time depending on your dog breed. Small dogs tend to get tired easily after playing catch, while Labrador retrievers need a lot of walks, at least 30-45 minutes twice a day to burn off energy. In addition, the poodle breed often has the characteristic of being active but never tired. They can run all day without getting tired.
- Regular exercise burns excess energy that, if left unattended, can lead to behavioral problems like gnawing, digging, or barking repeatedly.
- Remember to take the dog for a walk. Dogs need to take short walks twice or LONG once a day. Travel distance depends on your breed.
- Be careful not to let the dog run away. If your house has a yard and they are allowed to go outside, you will need to fence the yard so that the dog won't go away. The fence should be high enough for them to jump over.

![Take-Care-of-a-Dog-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-take-care-of-dogs/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Dog-Step-15-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.2 Get your dog excited by rewarding training. 

Just like humans, dogs are prone to depression. In order to lead a happy life, they need mental stimulation. Excitement can be achieved through obedience training. Train them to sit down, lie still, and come close when called.
- Most dogs are interested in a one-on-one training session, and sessions like these help your dog bond with you. If you use rewarding training where good behavior is rewarded with no punishment, your puppy will have a happy and positive training experience.
- Train twice a day, each lasting from 10 to 20 minutes depending on the concentration of the dog. Make sure to end each session with a positive attitude.
- Reward your dog every time he obeys your command. The reward can be small amounts of junk food (remember not to overfeed) or simply cuddling your dog every time he performs the correct behavior. Choose something encouraging your dog as a reward. 

![Take-Care-of-a-Dog-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-take-care-of-dogs/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Dog-Step-16-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.3 Teach your dog to interact with. 

Dogs need to learn to interact well so that when they grow up they can get along with their surroundings. By the time your puppies are a few weeks old, expose them to as many people, lights, sounds, and scents as possible if possible. At 18 weeks of age (when the dog stops adapting), they will consider these things normal and will not feel fear later.
- If your dog is an adult, you should still expose it to new experiences. Take care not to overwhelm them and be frightened if they feel uncomfortable. Be extremely persistent when exposing your dog to scary objects at the right distance so that they don't panic. Reward them for their calm behavior. Gradually move the object closer, continuing to reward your dog so that it can form a positive bond with the object.

![Take-Care-of-a-Dog-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-take-care-of-dogs/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Dog-Step-17-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.4 Give your dog the opportunity to play with and show normal behavior in the breed. 

For example, the Basset and Bloodhound hounds have a habit of following the scent. Give them some time to sniff their surroundings or turn them into a game by creating a smelly trail for the dog to follow.

## 5. Show Respect and Love for the Dog

![Take-Care-of-a-Dog-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-take-care-of-dogs/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Dog-Step-18-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 5.1 Register to identify and tag your dog's collar. 

This will help ensure that the dog can go home if it gets lost or separated from the owner. In the US, each state has different rules for dog ownership. An animal aid or vet clinic is often a place where you can ask about pet registration procedures and get advice on whether to wear collars and persistent tagging. Be aware that some cities restrict the possession of certain "dangerous" breeds such as bulldogs or guard dogs.

![Take-Care-of-a-Dog-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-take-care-of-dogs/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Dog-Step-19-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 5.2 Respect your dog. 

Never punish dogs with violence or underestimate them in all situations. This means naming them appropriately, rather than names like "Crazy Dog" or "Killer Dog" affecting other people's attitudes toward them.
- If your dog is misbehaving, find out what happened and whether your actions or passions caused the problem.

![Take-Care-of-a-Dog-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-take-care-of-dogs/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Dog-Step-20-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 5.3 Know that your dog needs basic needs. 

For example, the dog needs to go to the toilet often but does not stain the house or their body. Furthermore, it is inhumane to confine dogs for long hours without human contact or use the toilet. 

![Take-Care-of-a-Dog-Step-21]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-take-care-of-dogs/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Dog-Step-21-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 5.4 Prepare your dog to sleep comfortably and not be outside in harsh conditions. 

Leaving your dog outside during hot summers or unsafe winters can injure or even die. Ideally, leave your dog indoors in inclement weather, but if you can't afford it, provide a discreet place and plenty of water for your dog. 

![Take-Care-of-a-Dog-Step-22]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-take-care-of-dogs/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Dog-Step-22-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 5.5 Build loving and respectful bonds with your puppy. 

Dogs will love you for life if you treat them well. Spend time with them, getting to know their personality, and what will motivate them. The more you interact with the dog, the happier your life will be.
- Under no circumstances should you ever beat or mistreat your dog. Curse when the misconduct is the most counterproductive punishment. Dogs often forget what they did and will not understand why the owner is yelling at him.

> Advice
- Regularly visit the FDA's website to update recalled dog foods.
- If your dog becomes too aggressive, approach it slowly and cautiously. Do not come close from behind as they may view this as aggression and will bite you.

- Never hit a dog! This is cruel behavior and will only make them afraid of you. Instead, show your dissatisfaction by hiding the reward. Also, use positive reinforcement to promote good behavior in your dog.
- Pay attention to your pet's behavior. Dogs often give out signals that something is wrong. If you notice an unusual change in your dog's behavior or behavior, you should take him or her to the vet.
