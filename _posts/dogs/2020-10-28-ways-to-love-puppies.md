> Puppies are a very adorable animal and you cannot help but love them. Loving puppies is not simply about showing easy affection, but also meeting their basic needs (food, water, shelter) and nurturing into an obedient chubby dog. When you show your puppy love, he will return affection and become a great companion.

## 1. Help the puppy feel secure

### 1.1 Train your puppy to use a cage. 

Keeping a puppy in a cage is probably not an act of love. However, if done correctly, the cage training will help your puppy see that this is a comfortable and safe place, not a cell. [1] Additionally, this training also teaches puppies not to poke indoors as they do not like going to the toilet during sleep. [2]
- The size of the cage should not be too small to make the puppy feel cramped, and not too big for them to contaminate one place and sleep there. [3] However, keep in mind that puppies grow up very quickly. If you have a large breed, they will soon grow to a size far beyond your current sleeping cage.
- Unless at night, you should not keep your puppies in a cage for several consecutive hours, especially if they are younger than six months old. [4]
- Set up a comfortable sleeping cage by spreading a blanket and placing some toys in it.
- Give the puppy an order ("Get in," "Get in") into the cage. You should then reward them for completing the command. [5] After a while the puppies will enter the barn as soon as you give the order.

### 1.2 Place the puppy's bed near your bed. 

If you are new to adopting a dog, you need to calm him down while in a new environment. This is probably the first time puppies have been separated from their family, so they will feel anxious about being separated. [6] To soothe your puppy, make sure to arrange her sleeping place next to or in your bedroom. [7]
- Place a litter box, pen, or blanket on the floor near your bed. [8]
- You can decide if you want to let the puppy sleep together. Keep in mind, however, that once you stop letting your dog sleep in bed, he or she may develop behavioral problems in the future. [9]
- You can place the barn just outside the bedroom entrance. Always leave the door open. [ten]

### 1.3 Make your puppy comfortable. 

If you give your puppy something that smells like a new family, he'll feel more secure. [11] For example, you can expose your puppy to pillow cases or old clothing that smells like you or another family member. [12] The more you get used to the scent, the more your puppy will feel relaxed and secure in a new environment and with her "herd".
- Put some of the items listed above in your puppy's cage or bed / blanket to calm him down before going to bed.
- Consider having your puppy play with a "heartbeat" toy that simulates the sound of your dog's heartbeat. [13] You can place the toy in a place to sleep so that they will feel at ease while they are sleeping.
- Note that puppies are very destructive. Don't be surprised if they tear or chew on something that smells like you.

### 1.4 Do not keep puppies in the basement or garage. 

Separation anxiety will cause them to howl, whine, or bark. [14] For a good night's sleep, you may want to think about keeping your puppies in the basement or garage to keep them from making noise in the house. However, this is not a very effective way to do this because it only makes the dog more afraid and calls out louder. [15]
- If they are locked up in a basement or garage as a child, they will experience behavioral problems later when they grow up. [16]
- If your puppy screams at night and you want to check if it is okay, wait for a gap between the barking sounds. Don't approach it while the puppy is barking, as he or she will assume you will come when he hears his barking.
- Also, don't yell or ask the puppy not to bark, as you will make the dog think that you are “barking” with them too, causing the puppy to bark even more.

## 2. Play with your puppy

![Love-Your-Puppy-Step-5]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-love-puppies/v4-728px-Love-Your-Puppy-Step-5-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Take the puppy for a walk. 

Spending time playing with your puppy is a great way to show your puppy that you love him. Staying active through playing games also helps with both mental and physical health as the puppy matures. [17] Walking is not a game, but you can let your puppy play around for walks by allowing them to explore their new surroundings.
- Occasionally let the puppy stop and smell the flowers while walking. [18]
- Let your puppy interact with people and other dogs while walking. [19] Bring a reward. You can ask someone else to feed your puppy with each contact to form a good relationship. [20]
- Encourage your puppy to walk on the curb. [21] They will enjoy exercising balance on the curb compared to walking on the street or sidewalk.
- Use basic commands during a walk, such as "sit down" and "stay there," to reinforce your puppy's lesson. [22]

![Love-Your-Puppy-Step-6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-love-puppies/v4-728px-Love-Your-Puppy-Step-6-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Play hide and seek with your puppy. 

They quite like this game. You can ask someone to stand next to the puppy and hide, then call the puppy's name every few seconds until he finds you. [23] Reward your puppy and praise him when he finds you.
- If you are training your puppy to come to you when it is called, this is a good way to apply the command. [24]
- You can hide your puppy's favorite toy.
- Be aware that puppies can be frustrated if they cannot find a toy and may lead to their disinterest in playing the game. [25] So keep the toy in an easy-to-find place (behind the sofa, under the chair) until the puppy has mastered her nose to find it.

![Love-Your-Puppy-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-love-puppies/v4-728px-Love-Your-Puppy-Step-7-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Play fetch with your puppy. 

This is a great way to train your dog, as well as teaching him to focus and follow your instructions. [26] You can use a small toy or a soft doll as a throw to make it easier for your puppy to pick up and return to. [27]
- Don't throw sticks. This can damage the puppy's mouth, or cause digestive problems if they swallow the wood. [28]
- If your puppy doesn't understand what to do the first time, teach him how to pick up the toy and bring it back. [29] Throwing is a simple game, so it won't take your puppy that much time to learn.

![Love-Your-Puppy-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-love-puppies/v4-728px-Love-Your-Puppy-Step-8-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 Allow the puppies to play in the water. 

If your puppy likes water, then this is an underwater game you can play to show your love. Working in water usually requires little exercise, [30] and does not put pressure on their joints.
- Puppies can not swim when jumping into the water. For safety's sake, you should have them carry a pet buoy until you've mastered your swimming skills. [31] What kind of buoys are available at your local pet store, or online.
- You can let your puppy practice swimming in pools or quiet pools. [32]
- Play water fetch with your puppy. [33]
- Playing in the water can exhaust your puppy. You should give them a 10-minute break to restore energy. [34]
- Do not force your puppies to play underwater if they don't want to. [35]

![Love-Your-Puppy-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-love-puppies/v4-728px-Love-Your-Puppy-Step-9-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.5 Play tug of war with your puppy. 

This game enhances the puppy's physical strength as well as its confidence. [36] To start the game, choose a small, soft toy that your puppy can easily chew on. While playing, make sure your dog doesn't get too aggressive. [37]
- If the puppy growls with his head, he may be getting too excited.

![Love-Your-Puppy-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-love-puppies/v4-728px-Love-Your-Puppy-Step-10-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.6 Train your puppy using tricks. 

This helps to stimulate the dog's mind and body. Start with basic commands, like "sit down," and "stay." Once your puppy has mastered the basic commands, you can train more difficult commands and tricks, such as "roll over" and "fake death."
- Communicate tricks to teach your puppy to follow discipline, [38] and become a good dog later on.
- Reward your puppy with immediate positive reinforcement (reward, compliment, affection) when he or she performs the trick properly. [39]

![Love-Your-Puppy-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-love-puppies/v4-728px-Love-Your-Puppy-Step-11-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.7 Build navigable physics obstacles to train puppies. 

You can set up an in-house obstacle navigation course for them. [40] In a large room, position your furniture and other objects (paper boxes, toys) that your puppy will need to find a way to get past to reach you. In addition to acting as a game, this course also has the effect of boosting their agility.

![Love-Your-Puppy-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-love-puppies/v4-728px-Love-Your-Puppy-Step-12-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.8 Give the puppy a rest. 

Even though puppies love to run and play, they still need time to rest and restore energy. Each play and training session should only last 10 minutes. [41] In addition to resting between playtime sessions, your puppy will also need to sleep. [42]
- Sleep plays an important role in the development and maturity of puppies. If you let them play too much without rest, the puppy may become more grumpy. [43] Plus, you can adversely affect their natural growth.

## 3. Learn your puppy's body language

![Love-Your-Puppy-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-love-puppies/v4-728px-Love-Your-Puppy-Step-13-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Listen to your puppy. 

Knowing your dog's body language helps you be able to communicate with him and will love him more. Understanding the noise is one of their ways of perceiving body language. Whimpering and howling demonstrate distress, especially during the first few days of their new home. [44]
- Puppies can make a "grrr" sound in competitive games such as wrestling or tug of war. This low-pitched throat sound is often a sign of playfulness in puppies.
- Puppy owners often confuse "grrr" with aggressive growls and punish puppies, even if they only show excitement. [45]

![Love-Your-Puppy-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-love-puppies/v4-728px-Love-Your-Puppy-Step-14.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Observe how the puppy uses her mouth. 

Your dog may show its teeth in a sign of submission or aggression. If this is submissive behavior, the puppy will retract her lips and form creases in the corner of her mouth. Aggressive behavior is often accompanied by a growl and a bared of front teeth. [forty six]
- If your puppy yawns, they may be bored or sleepy. However, the act of yawning can also be a sign of stress or anxiety. [47] The situation in which your puppy yawns will help you understand the meaning of this action.

![Love-Your-Puppy-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-love-puppies/v4-728px-Love-Your-Puppy-Step-15.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Understand your puppy's rolling behavior. 

When your dog rolls over, this can be a sign of relaxation or fear and submission. If the puppy is comfortable, the body will relax: open the mouth, the hind legs swing to the side, and the tail slowly wags. When they feel scared or show their obedience, they put their heads on the ground and close their mouths. [48]
- The act of tailing the tail and raising the front and hind legs upwards is also a sign that the puppy is afraid or submissive. [49]

![Love-Your-Puppy-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-love-puppies/v4-728px-Love-Your-Puppy-Step-16.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Study the "mating" behavior of your puppy. 

The act of “mating” with another person or dog can be quite sensitive. However, they are not intended to harm anyone or any dog. For example, puppies will often "mate" with another during play to assert themselves as a winner. [50]
- Puppies 'mating' with humans is often a sign that they are happy or excited about something. [51]
- Instead of punishing the puppy for this sensitive behavior, divert her focus to another engaging game, [52] such as playing fetch.

![Love-Your-Puppy-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-love-puppies/v4-728px-Love-Your-Puppy-Step-17.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Find out why the puppy stopped playing. 

Even though your puppies love to play, you might be quite surprised to see them suddenly stop playing. This may be because the dog needs to deal with the sadness. In this case, you need to take them outside and see if they go to the toilet or not. [53]
- Puppies may also stop playing because they feel tired. They usually have a short term source of energy, so they will quickly tire and need rest. [54]
- A tired puppy can have a serious illness such as hypoglycemia or a vascular infection. If your dog has this, you need to see your vet. [55]

## 4. Give your puppy a healthy diet

![Love-Your-Puppy-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-love-puppies/v4-728px-Love-Your-Puppy-Step-18.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Choose high quality dry dog ​​food. 

Love for your pet is demonstrated through feeding a healthy and balanced diet. Veterinarians and trainers often recommend dry pellets to puppies. [56] Canned foods have a high fat content of about 80-85%. [57] Semi-moist foods are 50% water, but often contain sugar or salt as preservatives. [58]
- Note that not all dry foods are created equal. Poor quality feed uses inexpensive ingredients and contains protein that is difficult to digest, causing problems with your puppy's gut. [59]
- High quality dog ​​food uses premium ingredients and is easier to digest. The easier it is for the puppies to digest food, the less they have a need to eat and excrete less waste. [60]
- Each puppy has different needs, so talk with your veterinarian about what dry food is right for your pet. [sixty one]

![Love-Your-Puppy-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-love-puppies/v4-728px-Love-Your-Puppy-Step-19.jpg.webp)

### 4.2 Switch food slowly. 

You won't be able to cherish your puppy if he has diarrhea right after he gets home. To avoid this, stick to your puppy's previous food and eating schedule. After a few days, give your puppy new food for about seven to ten days. [62]
- For the first few days, you will need to measure the new / old food at a rate of 25% / 75%. After a few days, increase the percentage to 50% / 50%, 75% / 25%, and finally 100% new feed. [63]
- Change the rate slowly if the puppy has digestive problems (vomiting, diarrhea, constipation). [sixty four]

![Love-Your-Puppy-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-love-puppies/v4-728px-Love-Your-Puppy-Step-20.jpg.webp)

### 4.3 Don't give your puppy any leftovers on the table. 

If not, you are indulging them and this is not the way to show love. Inadvertently you teach your puppy the habit of asking for bad food. What's more, uneaten food contains very little of the nutrients your puppies need, and may even affect their digestive system. [65]
- Once the puppies have tasted human food, they will keep asking for more. So if you feed them like that, it's very difficult to stop. [66]

![Love-Your-Puppy-Step-21]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-love-puppies/v4-728px-Love-Your-Puppy-Step-21.jpg.webp)

### 4.4 Set up a feeding schedule for your puppy. 

When your dog eats on time, he will deal with his sadness at the scheduled time, making toilet training easier. Depending on your puppy's age, he or she will need to eat several times a day (three times a day if younger than six months, twice a day if over six months old). [sixty seven]
- Let your puppies rest for an hour to an hour and a half after eating (instead of taking them outside). This helps to prevent digestive problems caused by physical activity. [68]

![Love-Your-Puppy-Step-22]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-love-puppies/v4-728px-Love-Your-Puppy-Step-22.jpg.webp)

### 4.5 Don't overfeed your puppies. 

You often think that your pet is not eating enough, or that you need to eat more to grow. However, overfeeding (including forcing the puppy to eat more) can cause them to grow too quickly and develop osteoarthritis. [69] Talk to your vet if you think your puppy is not eating enough.
- Although the food bag often has instructions on how to feed your puppy, you should still consult your doctor about the right amount of food to promote the puppy's optimal health and development. [70]

![Love-Your-Puppy-Step-23]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-love-puppies/v4-728px-Love-Your-Puppy-Step-23.jpg.webp)

### 4.6 Give the puppy treats. 

They love to be fed junk food. In addition, this is also a useful tool in training puppies. In addition to training purposes, you should limit the amount of junk food to about 10% of your daily calories.
- Solid food is an ideal treat for your puppy. They can satisfy your needs for chewing, gnawing, dental hygiene, as well as entertainment. [71]

> Advice
- The first time you meet you will fall in love with your puppies, but they require a lot of effort and patience to be a lovable pet.
- Love for puppies is demonstrated through imposing fair and consistent rules and limits on them. [72]
- Dogs are social creatures, so take them with you whenever you leave the house. You and (family member) are the new “pack” of puppies, and they will want to spend as much time as possible with their family. [seventy three]

> Warning
- Puppies often experience isolation anxiety. If it is not working to put them to sleep near the bed, consult your veterinarian or animal behaviorist.
- Overfeeding your puppy can cause abnormal growth as well as other orthopedic problems. [74]
