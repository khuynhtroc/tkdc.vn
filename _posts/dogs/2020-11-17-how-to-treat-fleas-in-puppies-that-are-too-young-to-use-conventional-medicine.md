### 1.1 Understand why conventional flea products should not be used on puppies. 

The newborn puppy's body is the perfect environment for parasitic fleas because they are warm, moist, and very easy to absorb blood. Unfortunately, there are no flea products that are safe for newborn puppies. Puppies' internal organs are often more sensitive than adult dogs, and thus are susceptible to side effects from flea medications.
- Depending on the drug, possible effects are excessive drooling, vomiting, breathing problems and becoming extremely sensitive to severe irritation or depression.
- Some anti-flea products also clearly recommend on the label that they are not suitable for puppies. Other products have never been tested on puppies, so the manufacturers are often contraindicated for use on puppies.
- In particular, you should avoid using pet products containing Permethrin as these are not safe for puppies. The dog's metabolism is too weak and it is difficult to break down the permethrin, so it can accumulate in the puppy's body and cause nerve damage, leading to excessive tremors, drooling, and paralysis. or even convulsions.
- Permethrin-free products are often inefficient and a waste of money.

### 2.1 Understanding why it is important to treat the mother dog for fleas.

### 2.2 Use only prescription drugs, avoid over-the-counter or "natural" drugs. 

While it is okay to use a flea product for the mother, it is important to choose it carefully.

- Some over-the-counter products are often labeled "natural" or "drug-free", but that doesn't mean they are safe for puppies. And even without causing any negative side effects, these natural or herbal products are very ineffective in treating fleas.

## 3. Handling fleas in the environment

![Get-Rid-of-Fleas-on-a-Puppy-Too-Young-for-Normal-Medication-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-treat-fleas-in-puppies-that-are-too-young-to-use-conventional-medicine/v4-728px-Get-Rid-of-Fleas-on-a-Puppy-Too-Young-for-Normal-Medication-Step-11.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Understand the life cycle of a flea. 

Adult fleas often find a host for the parasite. For each flea found on pets, it is estimated that another 20 are living on bedding, carpets and sofas.
- Be aware that female fleas often lay eggs on soft objects such as carpets and furniture. Flea eggs are often very hardy because without a suitable host, they can sleep quietly for many years.
- When the eggs hatch, the larvae and nymphs will grow on carpet or bedding, eat dirt to complete their life cycle and become adult fleas.
- For this reason, remove eggs or larvae hiding in dog bedding, carpets and sofas if you want to prevent the risk of infecting the mother and puppies.

![Get-Rid-of-Fleas-on-a-Puppy-Too-Young-for-Normal-Medication-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-treat-fleas-in-puppies-that-are-too-young-to-use-conventional-medicine/v4-728px-Get-Rid-of-Fleas-on-a-Puppy-Too-Young-for-Normal-Medication-Step-12.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Wash the puppy's bedding to kill fleas.

As explained above, a puppy's habitat can be filled with fleas, larvae, and pupae waiting to molt and mature. Therefore, bedding should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected to completely remove fleas.
- Since flea eggs have extremely hard protective shells, spinning the bedding in the washing machine is not enough to destroy them.
- Use a spray product or a bomb that contains an insecticide. These components can spread and crept into each corner of flea eggs, larvae and nymphs. You should use pesticides according to the directions on the package.
- After spraying the pesticide and waiting for it to take effect, put the bedding in the washing machine and wash in hot water to remove the harmful chemicals in the medication (which can harm the puppies) and eggs , larvae and fleas die.

### 3.3 Spray insecticides to kill fleas on carpets and other fabric objects. 

Finally, you will need to kill any fleas that are living on carpet or other soft objects. You should spray an insecticide containing Permethrin such as Staykill or RIP fleas.
- Insecticide manufacturers often recommend vacuuming before spraying. This will loosen the carpet fibers and allow the spray to penetrate deeper. In addition, the vibrating effect of the vacuum cleaner can 'awaken' larvae that are full of hope to find a host.
- Spray the insecticide on carpets, sofas, and other soft objects according to the directions on the label. The Permethrin ingredient in the spray works by paralyzing the nervous system, suppressing muscle function and ultimately killing insects. Insects are not able to dissolve Pyrethroids like mammals, and are therefore very sensitive to the action of the drug.
- Be sure to isolate puppies, other pets (including birds and fish) or children from the room before spraying pesticides. After spraying is finished, ventilate the room for a few hours by opening a window to blow the residue out of the room.

> Advice
- If the mother dog, puppy or other animals infected with fleas are already in the car, don't forget to spray the insecticide inside the car.
