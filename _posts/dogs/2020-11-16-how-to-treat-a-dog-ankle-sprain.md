## 1. Recognize the signs of an ankle sprain

### 1.1 Understand your dog's bone structure. 

In fact, the dog stands and walks with the toes on the forelegs and hind legs. When the dog is standing, you should see the dog's ankle between the knee and the toes. The position of a dog's ankle is similar to that of a human ankle when standing with our toes (instead of feet). [first]
- Dogs do not have front ankles just as humans do not have "ankles". The foreleg is also more likely to have another type of sprain and is treated the same way as an ankle sprain.

### 1.2 Find out what causes an ankle sprain. 

Many dogs are very active. Excessive activity puts a lot of pressure on the joint, making it very susceptible to injury. [2]
- Running, jumping or making quick turns and making sharp turns will strain the joint.
- Not all dogs are hyperactive, but the pressure on the joint can be greater than the dog can tolerate. Sprains can also result from slips, falls, collapses or simple accidents when jumping on or off a chair. Any of these can cause a sprain in your dog.

### 1.3 Watch for signs of limping. 

The first and most often recognizable sign of an ankle sprain is a limp in the hind leg. [3]
- A dog with a sprain will often try to avoid putting weight on the injured leg.
- A dog can lift an injured leg high or low, depending on the severity. Your dog will avoid using the entire paws.
- Be wary of other reasons for your dog's hind legs, such as hip, knee or foot injuries. [4]

### 1.4 Watch for visible outward signs of injury. 

You may see some swelling or redness around your ankles if your dog sprains. [5]
- You may also notice that your dog licks his sprained ankle often.

### 1.5 Observe your behavior change. 

An injured dog can also change its behavior. Behavior changes that indicate a dog is injured are: [6]
- Becomes anorexia and eats less.
- Change your activity level, such as getting more sleep or being active reluctantly.
- Changes related to sounds such as barking, growling, or groaning when touching or moving ankles.

## 2. Treatment of an ankle sprain

### 2.1 Rest your dog. 

Resting your dog is the first step in treating a sprain. [7] To ensure your dog is well-rested, limit his activity. Dogs can be kept indoors or in a narrow space so that the dog cannot run or play. The less active your dog is, the faster he will recover.
- When necessary, tie the leash to the dog's neck and take the dog outside. You should take the dog for a leisurely walk over a short distance. [8] After that, the dog should be locked up as soon as possible so that the dog can rest.
- Limit your dog's activity to 48 hours to give him enough time to recover from the injury.

### 2.2 Apply an ice pack. 

To reduce swelling, pain and help the wound to heal quickly, you can place an ice pack on your dog's ankle for 10-15 minutes. [9]
- Use an ice pack to avoid freezing your dog's skin.
- Repeat this as needed, every 2 hours apart to prevent irritation, decrease circulation, and hinder recovery.
- You can use a bag of frozen vegetables like a bag of peas instead of an ice pack that can be wrapped around your dog's ankle easily. This effectively distributes the cold to the damaged tissue. [ten]

### 2.3 Apply heat. 

If you are an old dog, a dog that is chronically ill or injured, don't use ice. Instead, apply moist heat. [11]
- Heat can increase circulation, relax muscles and ease pain.
- Use a damp cloth that has been heated in a dryer or microwave. Make sure the towel is not too hot to avoid burning your dog's skin.
- Apply a hot towel to the wound for 10-15 minutes. You can reapply in at least 1 hour. [twelfth]
- Do not use the heat treatment right after the dog has been active.

### 2.4 Watch for signs of improvement or deterioration. 

During the 48 hours of resting your dog, keep a close eye on whether the injury is improving or getting worse. Most ankle sprains usually go away quickly after the dog is rested and treated. If your dog's feet do not get better after 48 hours or get worse, consult your veterinarian. [13]
- If you do not notice any improvement, your dog may need more rest and take medication prescribed by your veterinarian.
- At times, the dog can also injure somewhere else and interrupt the recovery process. If your dog has a more serious injury such as a dislocation or minor fracture, you should see your dog for a checkup or an X-ray if necessary.

> Advice 
- Treat your dog as soon as possible. Early treatment will help your dog recover faster and prevent tissue damage that can worsen the injury.

> Warning
- Do not try to bandage the injured area without advice from your veterinarian. Incorrect bandages can cause other problems such as skin irritation. Wrapping the bandage too tightly can also limit circulation, slow wound healing and cause more damage to surrounding tissue.
- Do not give any medication to your dog without first consulting your veterinarian. Prescription or over-the-counter medicines for humans are extremely dangerous for dogs. There are several human anti-inflammatory drugs that can be used to treat dogs, but the dosage will be different.
- If you don't notice any improvement within 48 hours, you should take your dog to the veterinarian right away. You should also contact your veterinarian if the condition gets worse. As with many serious injuries, dogs should be treated as soon as possible if the sprains get worse. [14]
