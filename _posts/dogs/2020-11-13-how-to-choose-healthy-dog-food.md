### 1.2 Determine your dog's nutritional needs. 

You need to consider your pet's caloric needs, but also remember that it is not calories from a single nutrient, such as protein or starch. For example, about 20-25% of calories protein is enough for a healthy dog ​​to grow and perform other activities.
- If your dog stays healthy with signs like: you can see his waist and can easily feel the ribs with the palm of his hand, it means your dog is in good shape. . If your dog weighs more than it needs to, reduce calories by 10-25% within a month and reassess. If your dog seems too skinny, increase the calorie intake by 10-25% and watch what happens. Maintain your calorie supply when the dog's desired condition has been achieved.
- If you feed your dog too many calories, they will accumulate in his body whether it is calories obtained from fat, protein or starch.

- If the pet occasionally has loose stools and self-regulates within a day and remains active and eating normally then that is not a problem. However, pets with persistent episodes of diarrhea that fail to hold and / or show other signs of illness, such as lethargy and poor appetite, should be checked, and changes in diet may be the way to go. handle such cases. Chronic itchy skin that is not caused by seasonal changes may be associated with food allergies. [3]

### 2.1 Do not believe in advertising. 

Remember that television, magazine and store marketing programs are aimed at people. Even the design of the label or the food box is intended to invite people to choose and buy. Do not be fooled by cute and eye-catching advertisements. Do research for the health of your dog.

### 2.3 In the US, make sure the feed label is stamped with the American Feed Association (AAFCO) accreditation mark. 

Becoming an AAFCO member is voluntary, but it will provide instructions on recipes and the manufacturing of pet food. The recognized feed label provides the basis for assuring customers that the feed meets the basic nutritional requirements for the animals listed on the package. [5] [6]

### 2.4 Check the ingredient list on the sticker. 

Dogs are omnivores that can eat meat, grains and vegetables. However, you should check that the first food ingredient listed is meat, such as "chicken" or "beef" rather than "meat by-product" or "cooked meat". When you see the word "chicken" on the ingredient list, it means that the meat is mostly muscle tissue, but may include the animal breast or heart (or other organs). [7]
- You also need to make sure that the first ingredient on the list is not whole grains or vegetables, unless you are feeding your dog on a diet for some reason.

### 2.5 Compare ingredients between different foods. 

The ingredient list on the label is listed by their weight in the food's recipe. Ingredients that contain water, like meat, are often at the top of the list.
- To compare dry food (10-12% moisture) and canned food (75% water), you need to consider the amount of moisture in the food if you want to determine the exact percentage of protein in the food. dog food.[8]To calculate the "dry matter index" of the amount of protein in a dog food box, you need to remove water from the food by calculation. For example, if the food contains 12% protein and the can contains 75% water, divide 12% by 25%, and you get 48% protein. This content is relatively high. (You use 25% in the denominator to reflect the rest of the food remaining after 75% water is removed). [9] [10] This will help you compare different types of dog food, even if they have been prepared according to different recipes.

### 2.6 Check the label for an "ingredient analysis" method that tells you the amount of protein, fat and fiber in your food. 

The recommended amount of food for your pet is based on its weight, and can be found on most food packaging.
- Of course, the manufacturer cannot accommodate the individual pet's needs, so please use this information as a basic guide and control the condition of the pet.
- You won't find calories either on the packaging or on the case either, so call the company or check the information online. [11]
- Consult your veterinarian if you have any questions about your pet's weight and condition.

### 2.7 Look for newly manufactured food packages. 

Once you have chosen a type of food, you need to make sure it is new. Check the expiry date on the package. Dry food is often sprayed with fat on the outside to increase its taste. Fat will go rancid after a period of exposure to light and air. Heat will increase the risk of going rancid. [twelfth]
- You also need to check that the packaging is airtight and free of punctures before buying home.
- Pet food stores often place the nearest food shelf on top or front in order to cycle inventory. They want to sell the nearest limited food first, which is understandable. Check if the product on the back or bottom of the shelf with a shelf life is still far away and pick them up if appropriate.
- While it may seem like you will save money if you buy a 20kg food bag for a 5kg dog, it's better to choose a small bag to ensure freshness, unless you store the food wrapped in a cupboard. Insulation to prevent moisture and freezing. Be sure to label the food bag with the food's name, batch number (in case food is recalled), date of purchase and expiry date. Take only the portion you need to use one day before feeding to allow the food to thaw completely.

- Dry dog ​​food is best used within 6 weeks of opening the package with proper storage conditions. [14]
