## 1. Take care of your dog's basic needs

### 1.1 Properly fed. 

Labrador dogs are very gluttonous. They love to eat, so they can often take their food bowls with them. This is normal. The exact amount of food you give to your lab dog depends on the type of food you eat and the amount of calories in it. Follow the feeding instructions on the package, and increase or decrease the amount of food depending on whether your dog loses or gains weight with this amount.[2]
- If your dog is more active but another dog, you should increase your food intake accordingly. For example, if you and your furry friend walk 8 kilometers every morning, consider feeding him more than usual.
- Obviously you don't want your Labrador to be obese. If you cannot feel its ribs easily, you are probably overfeeding. Also, do not let its ribs see from afar.

### 1.2 Give plenty of clean water to drink. 

Your lab dog will be very thirsty after exercising and will need to relieve that thirst. It will drink more or less water depending on how much it was doing and how hot the weather outside. Do not limit the amount of water the dog drinks. Unlike food, your dog will adjust to itself. Dehydration can be fatal, so don't do this.

### 1.3 Dog walking. 

Your lab dog needs a lot of practice to stay healthy. Take the dog for a walk 3 times a day if you can, for a few kilometers or more.[3]If you have a backyard, make sure it's large enough for the dog to run around. The small yard is not suitable for large breeds like lab dogs.

### 1.4 Provide comfortable accommodation. 

Whether your lab dog lives outside or indoors, make sure it has its own space. Don't forget to give your dog a sturdy large bed. Your lab dog will scratch on the bed repeatedly to relax. Cheap beds will tear easily and make a mess. [4]
- Your dog's own bed will help you train it not to lie on your bed, if you are disciplined. [5]

### 1.5 Groom your dog regularly. 

The Labrador is a short haired breed that is brown, black, and yellow. For many years, the lab dog will remain as short as that. During the summer, you will need to brush your dog regularly to remove hair loss, which is best every week. Grooming your lab dog will also help remove stains and help your dog's natural oils spread evenly. [6]
- Don't bathe your dog too often. The natural oils in lab dog's hair may even help prevent fleas and ticks.[7]Bathing your dog 3-4 times a year or when it smells bad. [8]

### 1.6 Cut your dog's nails. 

You should trim your dog's nails 2-3 times a month. If you regularly walk your dog, hard sidewalks will automatically wear your dog's paws. You can trim their nails at home or ask a veterinarian. Normally, you can train your lab dog to sit still while cutting nails, as long as you remember to reward him with each successful nail manicure. Gradually your dog will enjoy this. [9]
- Make sure to use a dog-appropriate nail clipper. Human nail clippers will not work. Keep the dog's feet in place and quickly trim the nails. Do not cut too close to the base of the nail. Doing so may cause pain and bleeding. Make sure the claw doesn't curl back into the dog's paw, otherwise it will be too sharp and cause undesired damage.[ten]

### 1.7 Clean the inner ear of a Labrador. 

Labrador ears can become a breeding ground for bacteria if they are not cleaned regularly and properly. Check your dog's ears regularly for dirt or smell, and seek advice from your veterinarian if anything is unusual. If you want to clean your dog's ears, use a product specifically designed for this.
- Do not use a cotton swab to clean your dog's inner ear. A sudden reflex can also seriously damage your dog's ear canal. [11]

### 1.8 Take care of your dog's teeth. 

The more active your dog is, the more likely it is that he will have dental problems. Gum disease, loose teeth, cracked / broken / broken teeth, root abscesses, and accumulated tartar are all things you need to look out for. You should take your dog to the vet to clean his teeth 1-2 times a year. Regular visits to the vet also help prevent bad breath. You should get wet kisses from your dog, and when this comes to your mind, here's another reason to clean your dog's teeth. [twelfth]
- Your veterinarian recommends brushing your dog's teeth every day or at least a few times a week. Buy a dedicated toothbrush and toothpaste from a pet store / large store or from a veterinarian. Some toothpastes are effective, many of which taste delicious - like liver, chicken, peanut butter - that your dog will love.
- Gently insert the brush into the dog's mouth. Use your fingers to lift your lips to expose your teeth. Brush your teeth in a circle, from tooth to tooth. Your dog's hind teeth are the hardest to brush, so brush them last. Make sure you brush both the inside and outside of each tooth. Reward the dog later.[13]

### 1.9 Take regular vet care. 

Every dog ​​needs to be vaccinated regularly. You should take your dog to the veterinarian at least every two years for regular checkups to monitor health and build good relationships with veterinarians. If your dog is injured or is not moving normally, see your veterinarian for examination and medical attention if needed. Your veterinarian will prescribe the right medication (main and complementary medications) to help prevent parasites like fleas and ticks.[14]
- As your dog gets older, you may find that your dog has health problems such as hip dysplasia, epilepsy, or seizures. Your dog may also have eye problems. [15] If any problems occur with your dog, immediately contact your veterinarian to discuss treatment options or to administer medications. Old dogs with these diseases should see a doctor every two months or as advised by their doctor.[16]

## 2. Proper dog care

### 2.1 Show lots of love for your lab dog. 

Lab dogs have a very emotional nature. If there is one thing the Labrador loves more than food, then it is to spend time with you - play, cuddle, or simply follow you.
- Don't leave your dog alone when he wants to play or stay at your feet when you watch TV. Chances are, the lab dog sees you as the leader or one of the leaders in the herd. So if you are indifferent, your dog will be emotionally affected.

![Care-for-a-Labrador-Retriever-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-labrador-retriever-dogs/v4-728px-Care-for-a-Labrador-Retriever-Step-11-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Help the Labrador to adapt to society. 

All dogs are territorial. Your lab dog is no exception. Barking at anything and everything is a natural version of a dog, but with the right care, they won't be too aggressive. Make sure to spend time at home and outside when training your dog. [17]
- If you have a lot of dogs, you will need to slowly introduce your new Lab dog to the dogs in the house. Put them in a room or outside space separated by a fence. Let the dogs sniff each other. They understand a lot by smell, so give them 30 minutes or more for them to get to know each other. Next, you put them closer together, but still chained. Do this several times, limiting the amount of time you spend with other animals to about half an hour each time. Only when you are confident that they will not attack each other can they run freely. Have them play together outside. Let them get along with each other. [18]
- Apply the above principle to the whole person. If your Labrador is getting used to playing around a lot of people, it should be introduced into this environment in a safe way. Keep your dog on leash. Ask someone / stranger around to poke the dog and be friendly with them. Have them reach out to the dog. Dogs often like to smell human hands to judge their scent. Perform regularly. Eventually your dog will learn to trust people. [19]

### 2.3 Teach your child how to play with the lab dog. 

Usually, Labrador dogs play well with children. However, if you have young children, you will have to watch them all the time when they play with the dog. Make sure the kid doesn't hurt or panic the dog, otherwise this will lead to a fight. Your dog is not mean. It doesn't hate your child. It can feel threatened. If it scratches or bites, then it is simply an instinct to defend against the threat. Try to limit this threat as much as possible. Be present when your child plays with the dog. [20]

### 2.4 Give your dog lots of toys. 

In particular, the lab dog's favorite toy is a tennis ball. This may speak of the "forgiving" nature within them. Since your lab dog was born to play wild games, he loves to play find and pick up objects. You can find plenty of other toys at the great pet store. Dog toys are a great way for your dog to play with and burn off excess energy without having to go out and run around. [21]

### 2.5 Teach your dog the basics of sitting, standing, and coming. 

Teach him how to walk on a leash. Labrador dogs are intelligent breeds and are usually very easy to train - especially when they are young. A trained dog will be confident and behave better. In addition, a dog that can listen to commands is safer in the absence of leash. [22]
- When training a Labrado dog, make sure to encourage positive behaviors instead of punishing them for negative ones. Labrador should never be hit. You are trying to build trust with your dog, not create an agitated and frightened dog. Dogs that attack a person or a child without intentionally are often the product of a violent environment. Don't let your Labrador be one of them. [23]
