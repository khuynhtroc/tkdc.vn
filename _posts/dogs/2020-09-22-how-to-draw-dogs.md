![Draw-a-Dog-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-draw-dogs/v4-728px-Draw-a-Dog-Step-9-Version-2.jpg.webp)

![Draw-a-Dog-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-draw-dogs/v4-728px-Draw-a-Dog-Step-12-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.6 Color according to taste!

## 5. Realistic dogs

![Draw-a-Dog-Step-49]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-draw-dogs/v4-728px-Draw-a-Dog-Step-49.jpg.webp)

### 5.1 Draw two ovals. 

The size of one shape may be slightly larger than the other, draw them separately but not too far away. This is the key to the drawing.

![Draw-a-Dog-Step-50]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-draw-dogs/v4-728px-Draw-a-Dog-Step-50.jpg.webp)

### 5.2 Overall outline. 

Draw a line going through the top of the two ovals but pointing downwards. Draw another similar line below the two ovals. For this line, you need to bend a little bit right between the two ovals. Then draw the top of the legs as shown. Stretch the two lines above and below the two ovals slightly upwards, then draw a circle that represents the head. Draw another oval skew to one side of the head to create the shape of the dog's muzzle.

![Draw-a-Dog-Step-51]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-draw-dogs/v4-728px-Draw-a-Dog-Step-51.jpg.webp)

### 5.3 Outline the first part. 

Do the same as when you draw the body. Then delete the circles inside the head and body. Draw more ears for the dog: long, down, or short, upright. Then, add a tail, long or short, it's up to you. At this point, it is better to have a picture of the breed in mind to present the details in the best way.

![Draw-a-Dog-Step-52]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-draw-dogs/v4-728px-Draw-a-Dog-Step-52.jpg.webp)

### 5.4 Delete all inner circles. 

Carefully erase the entire circle and oval guide. Then, show off the animal's fur by adding patches of coat color. You can also smudge the graphite a bit to give it shine or dark spots on the draft. Your dog will become very real!
