> Flea season can be a nightmare for you and your dog if you don't know how to get rid of this parasite. Some regions have warm climates all year round, which are favorable conditions for fleas to grow. The best measure is prevention in nature, but there are ways to get rid of fleas after they have hatched and colonized your pet. Here are a few ways to get rid of and prevent fleas from harming your dog.
 
## 1. Drug treatment

### 1.1 Bathe your dog with flea and tick bath oil. 

Regular dog bath oils and dishwashing liquid will also kill fleas, but if you need something stronger, you can try a flea and tick bath oil. [first]
- Read the shower oil label carefully for correct usage.
- Wet your dog's fur with warm water and apply flea bath oil to the fur.
- Wait at least 10 minutes after applying the bath oil to your dog's fur, then rinse with warm water.
- Flea bath oils often contain pyrethrins, a chemical used to kill fleas.
- Flea bath oils intended to kill fleas and ticks are readily available on dog's fur.

### 1.2 Buy a flea spray. [2] 

Flea and tick sprays are available in aerosol and pump form.
- For best results, choose aerosols with adult insecticides and control insect growth. This way you can be sure to kill both adult fleas and their eggs.
- Follow your veterinarian's instructions and label directions for proper use.
- Spray the spray in a well-ventilated area and avoid it in your dog's eyes.
- Wear gloves when spraying to protect yourself.
- When you want to spray on sensitive areas such as the dog's face, spray it on your gloves and rub it on the dog instead of spraying it in the dog's eyes, mouth or ears. [3]

### 1.3 Try flea powder. 

Flea powders are often sold without a prescription and work just as well as sprays. [4]
- Read the instructions on the label for correct use. If you are unsure of anything, check with your veterinarian before giving your dog flea powder.
- Usually, you can rub a thin layer of powder over your dog's fur and leave it as it is. However, it should be noted that the powder makes the dog's hair feel gritty and must be reapplied several times.
- Start rubbing it from the dog's head down to the tail, making sure the dough can contact the dog's skin. [5]
- You should also sprinkle the powder on your dog's bedside nest.
- Repeat once a week as needed. [6]

### 1.4 Make a dog bath medicine water. [7] 

Dog baths and rinse water should be used after the dog has started to be infected with fleas.
- Mix the soak or rinse according to the instructions on the package. Ask your veterinarian for further instructions.
- When using a dog bath, also known as a flea bath, you need to let your dog soak it in a dilute solution. Softener is a thin liquid that can be used to rinse the dog's body until the coat is completely wet. You need to completely immerse your dog in both of these solutions, not just individual areas of the dog's skin.
- Use soak and rinse water in a well ventilated area.
- After the dog has been soaked in water to make the medicine, most medicines should be left on, not rinsed with water. [8]
- These products often contain chemicals such as pyrethrins, permethrins, and organophosphates.

### 1.5 Wear a flea collar for your dog. [9] 

Flea collars vary widely in quality and many have a very limited range of activity, only killing fleas around the collar (around the dog's head and shoulders). However, a high quality flea collar can repel or kill fleas when used correctly. Be sure to choose a necklace that is appropriate for your dog's age and weight.
- Slide two fingers under the necklace to make sure it fits snugly and not too tight.
- Cut back on excess part of your dog's collar. Don't let your dog chew on the other end of the collar.
- See the instruction label to see how long the necklace lasts and what to avoid. Some collars reduce effectiveness if wet.
- Observe the dog's neck below the collar and remove if any irritation occurs.

## 2. Use flea prevention therapies

### 2.1 Apply monthly. [10] 

A monthly topical medication is one of the most effective and common for flea prevention.
- Most topical medications, also called “topical” medications, require a prescription from your veterinarian.
- Place a few drops or the prescribed amount of medication in a graduated bottle. There are medicines that need to be applied to the area between the dog's shoulder blades, others that need to be applied to different areas of the dog's body. Apply it to your skin, not just dog's fur.
- This medicine kills adult fleas that crawl into dogs or stings them. The drug is usually effective for a month.
- Some products also kill flea eggs, but not all products have this effect.
- This medication should be taken monthly and throughout the year. However, if you live in an area with icy weather in winter, you can use less during the cold months, as fleas are less active during this time.

### 2.2 Give your dog a flea pill every month. 

Ask your veterinarian about a flea-prevention pill to give your dog each month.
- Give your dog a food pill once a month.
- The veterinarian will prescribe the dosage of the drug based on your dog's weight.
- If the female flea stings the dog after the dog is given the medication, it will digest a chemical called lufenuron. This chemical will pass to the eggs and prevent the eggs from hatching. (Otherwise the adult fleas are also destroyed, then it may take a while to see results.)

## 3.Try natural flea treatments

### 3.1 Bathe your dog. 

Bathing your dog with warm water and mild dish soap or regular dog bath oil will also kill most fleas - if not all. [11]
- This is effective against small to medium flea bites, but may not be effective enough to eliminate flea outbreaks in large numbers.
- Use only a mild dishwashing liquid that is colorless, odorless and safe for sensitive skin. Stop using it if your dog has a bad reaction to the soap. Use conditioner after soap to avoid drying out your dog's skin.
- Soap your dog once a week. Bathing your dog too much (especially soapy baths) can damage your dog's skin by drying it out.
- Soap surrounds the fleas and pulls them away from the dog. Furthermore, soap breaks down the cell membranes of fleas and removes the protective wax layer. As a result, fleas can no longer retain water and die from dehydration.

### 3.2 Groom your dog with a flea comb. 

You can use a specialized flea comb, but any kind of comb with tight teeth can be used to brush your dog.
- Flea combs can remove fleas from dog hair.
- Groom your dog from head to toe. Make sure to brush your dog's skin close. If you brush only the outer bristles and don't get close to the skin, fleas can still remain after brushing.
- Dip the comb in the bucket of warm soapy water every time you catch a flea. Soapy water can kill fleas.

![Kill-Fleas-on-Dogs-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-in-dogs/v4-728px-Kill-Fleas-on-Dogs-Step-10-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Repel fleas with lemon juice. 

Diluted lemon juice applied to dog's fur can kill fleas. However, be careful not to dry out your dog's skin.
- Mix a bowl of solution with half lemon juice and half warm water.
- Alternatively, you can cut a lemon into quarters and add it to boiling water. Soak for eight hours or overnight, then filter and pour into a bowl.
- Dip a dog comb or brush in the lemon juice solution and brush the dog, allowing the lemon juice to come into contact with the dog's fur. Be sure to brush well and dip the comb into the solution after each brushing action.
- Repeat this once a day for three days. [twelfth]

### 3.4 Treat your dog fleas with apple cider vinegar. 

Apple cider vinegar can be applied to dog hair to treat fleas. [13]
- Mix half part apple cider vinegar with half warm water and pour in a spray bottle. Spray on the entire body of the dog, but focus on places where fleas are likely to gather, such as behind the ears, the buttocks around the tail, and under the feet.
- If your dog's skin is dry or you suspect your dog is reacting badly to vinegar, stop this treatment immediately.

![Kill-Fleas-on-Dogs-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-in-dogs/v4-728px-Kill-Fleas-on-Dogs-Step-12-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Try yeast. Brewer's yeast is a natural preventative and an alternative to harsh chemicals. [14] 

The evidence for the effectiveness of this therapy is uncertain, but yeast seems to have an effect on flea populations. [15]
- Add yeast pills to your dog's food every day or every two days. Consult with your veterinarian to determine the best dosage for your dog based on his age and weight. Do not determine the dosage yourself without the consent of your veterinarian.
- The yeast will be absorbed into the dog's skin and released through the pores. This will make the dog's skin and fur less attractive to fleas, thus helping to repel them.

![Kill-Fleas-on-Dogs-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-in-dogs/v4-728px-Kill-Fleas-on-Dogs-Step-13-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.6 Mix rosemary soaked for your dog. [16] 

This therapy has not been scientifically validated, but is believed to be effective in repelling fleas. Let your dog soak in rosemary water and let dry naturally.
- Soak 2 cups (500 ml) of rosemary stalks in boiling water for about 30 minutes. Use enough water to completely cover the rosemary.
- Strain and remove all the rosemary leaves.
- Add 4 liters of water to the rosemary water. Smaller dogs can use less water.
- Let the rosemary juice cool down. The water should be warm, but not too hot, or it will burn your dog.
- Flush the dog with water so that it is completely immersed. Let dry naturally.

### 3.7 Apply lavender essential oil. [17] 

This therapy has not been scientifically validated, but it is believed that it can be effective in repelling fleas. You just need to add a few drops of lavender essential oil to the key places to take advantage of this effect. [18]
- Bathe your dog normally with soap and warm water. Use a dry cloth.
- Apply a few drops of lavender essential oil to the rump around the dog's tail and a few drops on the nape of the dog. Use your hands to gently massage the dog's skin and fur.

> Advice
- Wash everything the dog comes into contact with to reduce the risk of the flea returning immediately after treatment.

> Warning
- Do not let your cat come into contact with your dog flea medicine. Many chemicals used in dogs are toxic to cats and can kill cats.
- Pregnant women, lactating women and children should avoid exposure to most anti-flea medications. Read the medication label for prevention information.
- Be careful when using a combination of anti-flea treatments; It is best to consult with your veterinarian before using multiple therapies at the same time. [19]
- Many flea medications are very powerful and can be harmful to people with long-term exposure to the medicine. Use gloves if possible and always wash your hands thoroughly after applying medication to your dog.
