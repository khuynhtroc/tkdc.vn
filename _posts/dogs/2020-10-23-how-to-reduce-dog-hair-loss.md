title: "How to reduce dog hair loss?"
summary: Almost all dogs have to shed sometimes. Heavy-shedding dogs, such as sheaves, often shed their hair year-round, but even low-shedding dogs like the poodle experience this from time to time. The amount of hair loss a dog sheds significantly depends on the weather and season, but the dog's overall health is one of the most important factors affecting the amount of hair loss. A dog that sheds more than usual is likely to have undetected health problems. While dogs cannot completely prevent hair loss, you can alleviate them by taking care of your dog's health and grooming the coat.
