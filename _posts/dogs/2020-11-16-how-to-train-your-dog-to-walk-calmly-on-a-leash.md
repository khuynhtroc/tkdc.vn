However, many dogs lead the way in the lead makes you tired, uncomfortable when walking, and can be dangerous if the breed is too large and strong. Don't be disappointed if your adult dog has that bad habit, it's never too late to train him to calmly walk on leashes. All you need is time, patience, and understanding of what actions will make your dog learn and obey.

## 1. Teach your dog to stay calm with the leash

### 1.1 Choose the right wire. 

If you are new to leash training, buy a specialized training leash with a short leash to help keep your dog within reach. This leash helps your dog focus on training, assisting you in changing his bad behavior quickly and effectively. [first]

### 1.2 Avoid using punitive training. 

Refrain from using training collars that are painful to your dog such as electronic collars, spiked collars or discipline chains in retraining the dog. Maybe the discipline chain and thorn collar will work because it works on the principle that the more the dog pulls, the more pain it hurts. However, you need to use it in moderation, as abuse will cause physical pain because they work based on fear, not actively learning the dog. [2]
- In addition, most trainers are not knowledgeable about the ways to change dog behavior that often use these collars. Don't let this get in your way, be a psychologist and retrain your dog with human love. [3]

### 1.3 Reduce your dog's excitement with leashes. 

The dog will become excited as soon as he sees the rope because he knows he is about to go for a walk. This leads to the act of pulling the leash while walking. If the dog is calmer when you leash it, you have almost succeeded in retraining it.
- To resolve this, practice wearing and unleashing your dog at home without taking him outside. The goal is to let your dog understand that wearing leashes does not mean walking. [4]
- For example, when you are at home, put your dog on leash but only let him walk around the house. After 5 - 10 minutes, remove the chain and put it away. Repeat about every half hour and the dog will become less sensitive to leash.

## 2. Teach your dog to walk close to you

### 2.1 Understand why the dog is pulling the leash. 

Most of them do because dogs love to explore where they are passing, especially busy and crowded places like parks. Dogs will also repeat the action when they are rewarded after the action. In this case, pulling the leash to run forward creates a reward because they know that doing so will get where they want to go faster.

### 2.2 Stop the excitement of taking a walk. 

Once your dog is calm on the leash, take him outside. This is like restarting all that excites the dog, because this is when it is actually going for a walk. To reverse this situation, spend a lot of time on this. Get the dog out, close the door, stop it, then go back inside.
- Repeat until both of you get bored, then the dog's excitement about pulling the leash to run ahead will disappear because he may just hang around at home like before.

### 2.3 Teach your dog to stop pulling on the leash to run first. [5] 

It is most effective if you spend a lot of time and are willing to think that what you are preparing does not actually lead to the results you want. Put the dog on a leash and take him slowly out of the house. As soon as it starts to pull, stand still. Hold the leash firmly, but do not try to pull the dog back to you.
- If your dog needs exercise, let him play ball in the yard to relieve his energy before going for a walk.
- If you are retraining for the dog to successfully pull the owner to the park, then you will need to start over all over again.

### 2.4 Reinforce positive behaviors. 

When your dog turns to look at you, encourage him to "Good job!" then continue to step forward. Repeat about 3 to 4 times, giving the dog some food as a treat.

### 2.5 Use an alternative method if you are unsuccessful. 

When the dog pulls you forward, stop and lead the dog in the opposite direction. If it continues to take the lead, stop and resume direction. The message you want to send to your dog is that if he continues to pull, he will no longer go forward, so he will have no motivation to pull. [6]
- For this method, when the dog tries to pull you faster, the result is that you stop, meaning it can't move anymore. Soon, the dog will realize that you are the only one in control of movement. You control time, place, and speed. Once the rule is established, the dog will no longer drag you.

### 2.6 Make time for training. 

It can take a while for your dog to change this behavior. Train regularly every day, but don't expect your dog to change within a week. It takes more time for the dog to understand the message you are sending and to follow it.
- After a month of such training, it is likely that the dog will no longer drag you before walking.
- Similarly, do not train for too long. We need short training times and repetition. Do not take your dog for long distances with this method, as it will quickly tire and get bored with training.
