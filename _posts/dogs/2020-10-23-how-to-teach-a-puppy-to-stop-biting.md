## 1. Understanding Bite Behavior in Puppies

### 1.1 Know how your puppy learns not to bite. 

Puppies often don't know how hard they bite, and so they bite very aggressively without understanding how it affects others. Puppies often learn that they are biting hard by playing with other puppies or large dogs. Your puppy will pick and bite each other while playing until the dog is in too much pain and yelps. The bitten dog will stop playing, and the bitten dog will be surprised and immediately stop playing.
- The next time the puppy plays and bites too much and receives the same response, he will begin to realize that biting can injure other puppies and people. Puppies use this to correct their behavior.

### 1.2 Understand your dogs' dynamics as the puppies grow up. 

Adult dogs tolerate puppy behaviors (occasionally disturbances), but they will become less tolerant as the puppies get older. This is because adult dogs think the puppies "should know more". Consequently, as the puppies get older, the adult dog's stern discipline shifts from a slight change in play to a quick warning, including a growling or a bite.
- In exceptional cases, when "teaching" the puppy, the adult dog will jump on the puppy and hold it on his back to teach a lesson; In most cases, the dog owner should not mimic this action unless directed and observed by an experienced trainer.
- Since this is a natural process, puppies often learn from adult dogs that biting is unacceptable before they are old enough to harm other dogs and humans.

### 1.3 Use judgment when training. 

When choosing a puppy training method, be mindful of the amount of time you can devote to training and the appropriate training method for your situation.
- If there are children in the home, it is important for the puppies to understand not to bite them, but it may not be appropriate for the puppies to participate in training.

## 2. Teach your dog not to bite

### 2.1 Play with the puppy until it bites you. 

When it bites, yell loudly, mimicking a dog's call with sounds that can be as loud and sharp as a dog's cry. Get up and stop playing with your puppy to reinforce that his behavior is unacceptable.
- If you are using a clicker when training a puppy, click it as soon as the dog releases your hand or stops biting.

![Get-Your-Puppy-to-Stop-Biting-Step-5]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-puppy-to-stop-biting/v4-728px-Get-Your-Puppy-to-Stop-Biting-Step-5-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Let your hand relax when the puppy bites you. 

The jerky action of the hand due to pain, although obviously a natural response, can encourage the puppy to play harder and continue to bite. As you move your hand, you are encouraging the hunting dog, which will make him want to continue to bite you. On the other hand, a relaxed arm would be less enjoyable to play with.

### 2.3 Play with the dog again. 

If it starts to bite again, shout or harsh reprimand and stop playing again. Repeat these steps no more than 3 times in 15 minutes.
It's not obvious that you push your puppy by trying to train it for too long. The puppy will not learn how to stop biting and its behavior will continue.

### 2.4 Reward your dog for a positive response. 

In between unintentional bites, if your puppy licks you or tries to cheer you up, praise and / or reward it. Your puppy should be rewarded and encouraged to provide positive feedback including not biting.

### 2.5 Stop reacting for a moment if screaming alone doesn't work. 

When the puppy bites, yell loudly and extend your hand to signal that the play is over, then ignore the puppy for 20 seconds. Isolation from the herd sends a strong message to the puppy that it is not behaving properly. [3] If the puppy continues to bite, get up and walk away for 20 seconds.
- After 20 seconds, you can go back and start playing again with the puppy. You need to convey the message that light play is recommended, but strong play is not. Play with the puppy until the same result occurs and repeat the steps to ignore / stop playing.

### 2.6 Decreased your puppy's stamina against bite force. 

If you let your puppy know that a strong bite is not acceptable, your puppy will try to bite more lightly. Continue to stop the hardest bites that follow, and so on until your dog is able to bite your hand gently and learn to adjust the force of the bite.

### 2.7 Be patient and persistent. 

This can take a long time, especially with highly predatory puppies. The method will be effective, but you can get a lot of bites during training.

## 3. Teach Good Habits

### 3.1 Encourage the puppy to play with other friendly puppies and large dogs. 

Playing with other vaccinated dogs is a common part of dog childhood. And as in your childhood, it's a time of exploration and learning. Regular play with well-taught dogs, dogs that do not need to be taught not to bite, will encourage the puppy to play well around other dogs and you. [4]
- Consider enrolling your puppy in a puppy training class, where your puppy learns essential skills while playing.

### 3.2 Use a puppy's favorite bone or rodent toy instead of letting the puppy bite you. 

Take out the toy or bone and let it bite into it. [5] This will teach your dog that his teeth should only be bitten by toys or bones, not to bite you.

![Get-Your-Puppy-to-Stop-Biting-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-puppy-to-stop-biting/v4-728px-Get-Your-Puppy-to-Stop-Biting-Step-13-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Join other play activities. 

Roughly playing with your hands is fun, but it can lead your puppy to think wrong. You can encourage other play activities, but don't let the puppy bite your fingers, hands, ankles, and toes.
- Learn how to be a bully with your puppy. Follow the same rules every time you play.
- Learn to play tug of war with your puppy. Stick to the same rule to encourage the puppy to stop biting when it comes to your hand. [6]
- Provide many exciting new toys for the puppies to play. A bored dog is more likely to seek your attention by biting. Change toys to make your dog less bored.

### 3.4 Use an unpleasant tasting repellant to keep your dog from biting you. 

Before you start playing with your dog, spray the anti-bites on areas of your body and clothes that your puppy likes to bite down. [7] When your dog starts to bite you, stop all activities and wait for it to react to the anti-biting agent. Praise the dog and continue playing when the dog drops it.
- Some options for anti-bites include bitter apple, [8] lotion, tea tree oil, or white vinegar. Alternatively, you can use a mouth-watering spray (like Binaca) that has an unpleasant taste and sound to spray the puppy's mouth when he bites it.
- Spray your body and clothing with anti-bite agent (if it's safe for clothes) for at least two weeks. After two weeks, your puppy will be extremely disgusted with your hands and ankles.

### 3.5 Make sure your puppy gets plenty of exercise. 

A well-trained dog (exercising until tired) will not be rude to play with you. This will help avoid developing bad habits the first time around. A tired puppy is usually a well-behaved puppy.

![Get-Your-Puppy-to-Stop-Biting-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-puppy-to-stop-biting/v4-728px-Get-Your-Puppy-to-Stop-Biting-Step-16-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 3.6 Don't "get poisoned". 

Sometimes you want to punish your puppy by patting, hitting, or waving your finger at the dog's face. The problem is that these reactions can lead to one of two things: they may encourage the puppy to continue playing rough, or it may cause the puppy to respond angrily. Avoid other physical punishment that may scare or imitate your puppy.
- If you are planning to use these penalties, you should contact a dog trainer or animal behavior specialist for help.

### 3.7 Regular games should not be banned. 

You may not like being bitten when you go out with your puppy, but you really want to take off the real leash between you and your puppy, and playing is part of this. Don't skip playtime just because your puppy doesn't know how to play lightly. Teaching it the difference between right and wrong, not just playing will be the best way for both.

## 4. Avoid the Bite Game

### 4.1 Take the dog for a walk every day. 

Check your puppy's vaccination status before taking him for a walk in a public place with lots of other dogs. [9] [10] Be sure to leash the puppy for its own safety.

### 4.2 Replace your hands with a bitten toy. 

Give your puppy a chance to bite the appropriate toy. Reward your dog for playing the toy.
- If your puppy is hesitant about the toy, try applying some tuna juice or peanut butter on the toy to make it more appealing.

### 4.3 Make the puppy stop playing if he is playing roughly. 

If your puppy starts to play too rough, you can force the puppy to "stop" playing for a while, even before it bites. [11]

> Advice
- You may need professional help if none of the methods above are specific.
- Dogs begin to develop adult teeth when they are 4 months old. It is best to complete the training before this stage, as adult teeth can do more harm than young teeth. [twelfth]
- Small breed dogs can also cause dangerous bites; You should not skip training your puppies just because they are young.
- Allow a large dog of a good character to self-discipline the puppy. Although upbringing may seem strict, adult dogs are quite adept at teaching puppies proper manners.
- Keeping track of your preschool puppy's playtime can be a great way to detect your dog's biting behavior and correct it.
