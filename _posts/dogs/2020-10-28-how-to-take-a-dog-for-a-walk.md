## 1. Walking the dog: basic notes

### 1.1 Wear a collar and leash on your dog. 

There will come a time when your four-legged friend notices the time for a walk when you can just reach for the leash. You should get used to this early by using a collar from a young dog. Put a collar on your dog and say “Go out”, and show the leash at the same time.

### 1.2 Wear the necklace snugly, but not too tight. 

Make sure not to put a collar too tight on your dog. As a general rule, you should be able to fit a finger or two between the dog's collar and neck. [1] The collar should not be too loose to avoid slipping through the dog's ears when it struggles to escape.

### 1.3 Decide which side to take the dog on. 

Consistency is important when training a dog for a walk. Choosing a side to lead the dog will help him recognize this activity. Your dog will get used to going for a walk by knowing what will happen. Remember, walking with a leash is not a natural activity for dogs. [2] It may take time to adjust.

### 1.4 Pull the rope close to the body. 

The most important thing when walking the dog is to maintain control so that the dog is not in control. You are the owner of it, and this must show up while walking. [3]
- Wrap the leash around your hand so the dog is only a short distance from you.
- Pull the leash close to the body, but leave enough space for the dog to walk naturally.
- The dog will feel the tension on the leash and will know that it cannot get ahead of you.

### 1.5 Talk to your dog. 

Your puppy will understand your voice. Don't lose your temper. Encourage your dog by saying "Well done" or "Well done" every time he gets it right. Use a stern tone when teaching your dog not to do something, such as barking passersby or growling at other dogs.

### 1.6 Reward your dog with a treat. 

Use treats to teach your dog to walk, especially if you want to teach your dog not to pull on leash. You need to reward your dog regularly and consistently. [4]
- Save a treat that your puppy is particularly fond of for training purposes. Many dogs are very excited about things like sausage, cheese or dried beef.

## 2. Buy suitable equipment for walking the dog

### 2.1 Talk to your veterinarian before purchasing a walking dog device. 

Your veterinarian knows your dog just as well and can recommend the type of equipment you need. Trust your vet to choose the right collar and leash for your dog breed or a specific weight. They can give you tips on how to avoid neck problems in your dog due to the inappropriate collar. [5]

### 2.2 Buy collars and leashes that are suitable for your dog. 

There are many types of dog collars and leashes on the market, but not all are suitable for your dog. For example, the traditional buckle necklace and the leash are often used for dogs that are easy to maneuver while walking. For dogs that are more difficult or uncooperative, you can choose collars and leashes that are more manageable. [6]
- Sliding collars help control distracting dogs.
- Control collars help tame dogs who tend to pull.
- A horse-belt collar is useful for dogs with a long neck.
- Specialized necklaces include shock necklaces, vibrating necklaces and GPS collars.
- A necklace that glow in the dark will make it easier for everyone to see you and your dog.

### 2.3 Consider using a clicker device to train your dog. 

This device is highly regarded for its safety and effectiveness in training dogs. You can use a clicker to reinforce good behavior and to communicate clearly and concisely with your dog. The sound of the clicker, and then the reward, will tell the dog it did the right thing. [7] The clicker approach is effective in training dogs for walks as well as when training other behaviors, such as barking, going to the toilet, and doing games. Use the clicker, followed by the reward in the following steps:
- Start wearing necklaces and leashes.
- When the dog stops resisting the leash.
- When the dog is behind you or beside you.
- Repeat as often as you go for a walk.
- When you go home and remove the leash.
- Repeat daily.

## 3. Make sure the walk is comfortable

### 3.1 Know when it's too hot for a dog to walk. 

Temperature will be the deciding factor for the best time to walk the dog. Early morning and late afternoon are good times of the day for you to walk your dog. Avoid going at noon when the sun is already high, as sidewalks can be too hot for your dog's paws. The best way to try to see if something is too hot is to put your hand on the sidewalk. If you have to lift your hand after just 5 seconds it means the place is too hot .. [8]

### 3.2 Bring plenty of water and food. 

In addition to a dog waste bag and clicker, bring a food bowl and a water bottle for your dog. Keeping your dog hydrated is important when walking for long periods of time in hot weather. During the summer months, you will need to bring more water with you. [9] Healthy and simple snacks to bring include:
- Strawberry
- Seedless watermelon
- Apple slices
- blueberry
- Carrot
- Ice blended on hot days

### 3.3 Rest as needed and go into a cool, shady place when possible. 

Don't overdo it when you get your dog used to walking, especially the first time he wears a collar and leash. Puppies can be exhausted from pulling and resisting. Find a shady place to rest for a few minutes while walking.
> Advice
- Carry a spray bottle of cool water to keep your dog from fixing other dogs.
- Clean up any waste that you have while walking.
- Talk to your dog and practice voice commands throughout the walk.
- Avoid the muzzle, as this can cause the dog to become aggressive.
- Get your dog acquainted with other dogs from a young age.
- Do not use electric shock necklaces and spiked necklaces. Using fear and pain to teach your dog the right behavior is a very wrong way to do it.
- Avoid using a stretch leash, as this will teach your dog that he can pull for freedom to roam, and it will be difficult to stop it when it pulls.
- Once the dog has grown, it will take more time to get to know other dogs.
- When walking your dog, bring your dog's favorite food and toys with you. If your dog stops moving and refuses to move, throw these items out to get his attention.
