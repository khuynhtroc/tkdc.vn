## 1. Treat your dog with diarrhea through diet

### 1.1 Abstain from feeding your dog for 12-24 hours. 

Food in the intestines contracts the intestinal wall to push food through the intestines. If the dog has diarrhea, the contraction will occur more strongly, so the food will be pushed more quickly in the form of loose stools. Abstaining from feeding your dog for 12-24 hours will help soothe and normalize the bowel movement in a state of sensitivity.

### 1.2 Give the dog clean water. [1] 

While you are fasting, give your dog clean, cool water. Look at the bowl of water to see if your dog is drinking. Drinking enough water helps your dog to reduce the risk of dehydration.

### 1.3 Give your dog a bland diet after the time is up. 

After the fast, you MUST NOT return your dog to his normal diet right away. Instead, give your dog food that is easy to digest.
- Ideally bland diets are fat free and red meat free.
- Give the dog the chicken, but it must be the uncooked chicken. Only give the dog meat and avoid chicken skin.
- Combine the chicken with white rice, pasta or mashed potatoes.
- Avoid milk and dairy products as many dogs are lactose intolerant and lead to diarrhea. Mashed potatoes for dogs should also contain no butter.
- Bland foods will only help relieve diarrhea (and make stools a bluish-gray color), and dog feces won't be completely normal right away. Wait for the stools to improve and show your dog's recovery.

### 1.4 Follow your veterinarian's recommended diet. 

If your dog is unable to eat home-prepared bland foods, ask your veterinarian to give him a stomach-healing diet. Some diets like Hills ID and Purina EN have been shown to promote recovery from diarrhea.

### 1.5 Redistribute the serving size. [2] 

Small meals cause less bowel irritation and spasm. After the period of fasting, the amount of food your dog eats a day should be equal to his normal diet. However, you should divide it into four smaller portions and feed your dog throughout the day. Breaking down your diet helps prevent diarrhea from recurring.

### 1.6 Slowly return to normal food. 

Once the diarrhea has subsided, you can start feeding your dog back to normal. However, don't immediately start using a normal diet for your dog, as it takes time for the gut to recover. The dog should be fed bland food for 2 days to make sure the diarrhea stops. The next 2 days will be the time to gradually switch to a normal diet through the following methods:
- Mix ⅔ bland food with ⅓ normal food.
- Switch to ⅓ bland food with ⅔ normal food for the next day.
- The dog should be able to eat normally again by day 3.

### 1.7 Take probiotics. 

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria for digestion and help dogs recover from diarrhea. Probiotics can be lost when dogs have diarrhea. It then takes some time for the probiotics to return and the digestive performance to be enhanced. Probiotic supplements help increase the number of beneficial bacteria. In general, you can mix probiotics with food and feed your dog once a day, for 5 consecutive days.
- The natural probiotics in the gut of dogs are different from those found in the human gut. Therefore, you should not give your dog the human probiotic.
- A wide variety of dog probiotics are available without a prescription from your veterinarian, pharmacist, or major pet stores.

### 1.8 Do not give your dog any human diarrhea medicine. 

The steps above will help treat mild diarrhea in your dog. On the other hand, giving your dog pills to reduce bowel movements could lead to a serious underlying problem and when found out, it's too late. If your dog does not get better at first after 2 to 3 days using any of the above methods, take your dog to the vet. [3]

## 2. Decide whether or not to see your dog

### 2.1 Determine if your dog has ingested dangerous food. 

Diarrhea is usually caused by the dog eating something he shouldn't. In most cases, the dog should be back to health after having thrown the food out.
- However, you should take your dog to the vet immediately if you find that your dog has ingested a toxic food such as rat poison or household cleaning products.

### 2.2 Take your dog's temperature. 

Simple diarrhea is rarely accompanied by fever. The symptoms of a fever indicate that the dog has some kind of infection / infection. To measure your dog's temperature, ask someone to keep the dog still by running the push arm under the dog's belly and pulling the dog's hind legs toward his chest. Next, the person must use the other hand to fix the dog's chin. Gently restrain and coo to your dog if it wiggles. Wear a muzzle if you are afraid the dog will bite you during the temperature measurement.
- Lubricate the thermometer, then lift the tail up and gently insert the thermometer into the dog's anus. For bitches, avoid inserting the thermometer into the vulva just below the anus by mistake.
- Do not push the thermometer firmly to avoid damaging the dog.
- After the thermometer signal completion, you can pull out the thermometer and read the results.
- Normal temperature is about 38 - 39 degrees C.
- A temperature of 39.7 degrees C or higher indicates that your dog has a fever. [4]

### 2.3 Be careful if your dog has diarrhea and is vomiting. [5] 

Vomiting in combination with diarrhea is often dangerous as dogs will become twice as dehydrated. This puts the dog in serious dehydration and is even more worrying if the dog is unable to drink and tolerate water. If this is the case, you should seek immediate medical attention.

### 2.4 Check for dehydration. [6] 

The essence of diarrhea is that feces contain a large amount of fluid. If the dog has excessive diarrhea and is unable to rehydrate in time, the dog will become dehydrated. Dehydration reduces blood supply to organs such as the liver or kidneys, and potentially damages.
- To check for dehydration, lift the nape of the dog's neck from the shoulder blades, then release.
- If the nape of the neck is turned in the correct position relative to the shoulder blade, the dog's skin is well hydrated.
- If your dog is dehydrated, the skin will be less elastic and it may take a few seconds or longer to return to the correct state.

### 2.5 Check if diarrhea is accompanied by blood. [7] 

If the diarrhea is accompanied by blood, it may indicate inflammation or bleeding in the dog. Inflammation is only uncomfortable, but bleeding can be life-threatening. You can't tell the difference between inflammation and bleeding at home, so see your dog immediately if there is blood in the dog's stool.

### 2.6 Watch if the dog is depressed, lethargic, or depressed. [8] 

Dogs with mild diarrhea can stay alert. If your dog has diarrhea but has bright and alert eyes, watch carefully to prevent the development of the above symptoms. You can control the problem on your own and do not need to see a doctor.
- However, if your dog appears lethargic, lethargic, unstable, or worse, depressed, you should seek medical attention.

> Advice
- When you visit your vet, bring a fresh sample of stool to your doctor for the stools test and smear test.
- Some dogs do not respond positively to canned food. Consider giving your dog a premium dried food or mixing canned food with dry food.

> Warning
- Diarrhea accompanied by mucus indicates intestinal irritation. Worms, live pig heart and some diseases can cause mucus to be mixed in the stool.
- During the treatment of diarrhea, do not give your dog any food he has never eaten.
- It should be done slowly when converting dog food to avoid worsening the dog's illness and diarrhea.
- Blue-green diarrhea in puppies can be attributed to coccidiosis. Seek medical advice immediately if your dog has this problem.
- Excessive fecal diarrhea in puppies can be life threatening if it is not taken to the vet immediately.
