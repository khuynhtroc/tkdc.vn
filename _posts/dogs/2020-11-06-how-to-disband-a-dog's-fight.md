title: "How to disband a dog's fight?"
summary: Usually, when one dog struggles and bites the other lightly, most of the time they are just playing with each other. But, sometimes the game goes too far and turns into an increasingly fierce chaos. If the dog is still not showing signs of stopping quickly, then it is important to intervene before one of them is injured.

## 1. Stop the battle from afar

### 1.1 Keep calm. 

Most dog fights last only a few seconds. Your biggest advantage in this situation is a clear head. The most effective thing you can do is startle your dog to distract him.[first]
- Stop the thought of wanting to grab your dog's collar. This may be the first impulse to come to mind, but when your dog is really fighting, even if it is not aggressive, it may come back suddenly and instinctively bite you. When the dog's body hardens and does a real fight, you should not play around, nor risk touching them.

### 1.2 Make as much noise as possible. 

Dog fights don't last long, so take advantage of whatever you have in hand.
- Scream, hiss, stomp his feet, and clap - do whatever you can to distract your dog's attention.
- If you have a metal dog bowl or a tin bin nearby, you can smash two metal objects together. [2]

### 1.3 Quenching the "fire" of fighting.

Using water - as much as possible - will be very effective in getting your dog's attention. Splash water into battle with a hose, bucket or even a glass of soda in hand. This will do no harm, even though it is only slightly wet, the dog does not like to get wet, so they will be discarded in most cases.
- If you are going to a dog park or somewhere with a lot of strange dogs, bring a spray of water to use in case of an emergency.

### 1.4 Use a barrier to separate them. 

Find out if there are objects that you can use to separate them. A large cardboard piece, a piece of plywood, a dustbin cover, a large stick of firewood - anything that can be used to separate dogs without risking your hands.

### 1.5 Toss a blanket covering the chaos. 

Some dogs will stop fighting when an opponent is no longer visible. If you have a large blanket, tarpaulin, coat or a piece of opaque material, try to cover it in a fight to calm the dog. [3]

## 2. Know when to intervene and how to intervene

### 2.1 Know the situations in which you need intervention. 

Again, it is important to note that most dog fights last only a few seconds and can go worse than expected. The war between aggressive breeds requires intervention because these dogs have trouble reading social cues from their fellow breeders. In addition, you also need to take action for battles between dogs of different sizes, between two females in heat, between dogs that have experienced physical abuse in the past or look Not likely to leave. [4]

### 2.2 Do not get in between the two dogs. 

In most cases, you should not interrupt between two dogs that are actually biting each other. In a moment of confusion, your dog will mistake you for another target and bite you.
- In a small dog, you can step between them to block your view and distract the situation.

### 2.3 Grab and hold the dog. 

Approach your dog from behind and grab the top of the hind leg. Lift its hind feet off the ground as if you were pulling a wheelbarrow. Start walking backwards, making a circle in one direction so the dog cannot turn around and bite you. [5]
- This works best when someone grabs the other dog's hind legs and the two of you pull them apart.
- Never put your arm in a doom as you could get bitten.
- You can also use a leash around the hind legs and pull the dog out of the fight.
- Once you have separated the dogs, you must keep them out of sight. If they still see each other, they will continue to fight. Keep your dog in a car or behind a door as soon as possible. Use a belt or tie as a temporary leash if the dog has no leash and if you are alone. Tie a dog to some stationary object, and then take the other dog elsewhere.

### 2.4 Use your feet. 

If there is no other way and you feel like you need to intervene with your body to prevent serious harm to your dog, you can use your feet and paws to push the dog aside (inside if you wear thick pants and sturdy shoes).
- Be aware that this should only be used on small dogs, not dogs that are biting too aggressively as they will bite you in the leg. Understand that you are putting yourself at risk of harming yourself. This method is not recommended for large breeds such as the German Shepherd (also known as a shepherd dog), as you are likely to be seriously injured from a deep bite in the groin area.
- This technique is especially effective when many people work together.
- There is no need to kick or try to hurt the dog; our goal is to separate them.
- After separating the dogs, don't forget to protect yourself. Specifically, if one or more dogs become aggressive towards you, don't turn away and run - just stand, continue facing them, and avoid eye contact. [6]

## 3. Stop right before the battle starts

### 3.1 Observe how your dog interacts with other dogs. 

Does it bark, grab or bite? What is the way your dog often plays aggressively? If you are aware of the behavior your dog displays around other dogs, it will be easy to see if there is a potential scuffle.

![Break-Up-a-Dog-Fight-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-disband-a-dog's-fight/v4-728px-Break-Up-a-Dog-Fight-Step-10-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Observe the dog's body. 

When dogs play together, the sounds are quite similar to when they fight.[7]Dogs will growl, bite each other's jaws and bite each other violently. Instead of listening, observe their body. If your dog seems relaxed, relaxed, and tailed, he is probably just playing. But if the dog's body appears tense, not pliable, and has a droopy tail, he is probably preparing to fight.[8]

### 3.3 Interfered with harassment and rough play. 

In some cases, one will think is playing, while the other will not. If you realize that, you better separate them.[9]
- Playtime can be rough from time to time even though both dogs seem amused. For example, a large dog can accidentally injure a smaller dog.

![Break-Up-a-Dog-Fight-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-disband-a-dog's-fight/v4-728px-Break-Up-a-Dog-Fight-Step-12-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Do not encourage dogs to compete with each other. 

Dogs can fight for food and toys. Some breeds tend to defend ownership of what they love, while others are sharper. By understanding your dog's typical personality traits, you will be able to prevent a fight from happening if you see another dog nearby.
- Take treats, food, and toys away while your dog is 'socializing' with other dogs.
- If you have a lot of dogs and they tend to compete, give each one a separate room.

### 3.5 Teach your dog how to play properly. 

From the moment the dog comes home, it is your responsibility to teach your pet not to attack others. Apply positive reinforcement to reward good behavior. When the dog begins to bite, growl, or exhibit other violent behavior, separate it from the object it is playing with and quarantine it until the dog calms down.

![Break-Up-a-Dog-Fight-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-disband-a-dog's-fight/v4-728px-Break-Up-a-Dog-Fight-Step-14-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.6 Teach your dog to run until called. 

If your dog obeys and runs to you every time you call, you should be able to pull him out of most bad situations before the stress escalates. Start training dogs to run to and linger from a young age, practicing regularly, especially if you have a lot of dogs.

> Warning
- Always chain the dog every time you take him outside. Sometimes, even trained dogs cannot resist the urge.
- Introduce new dogs slowly to each other - this approach prevents fights better than just letting dogs meet themselves.
- If you are bitten, get medical attention immediately. Be careful and anxious!
