## 1. Improve dog's coat

### 1.1 Provide a healthy, balanced diet for your dog. 

Buy foods with a balanced nutritional content for your dog. You can ask your veterinarian to recommend the right product and dosage for your dog. A nutritious diet is very important for maintaining the health and coat of the dog.
- If you want to make your own dog food, you should consult with your veterinarian about how to balance minerals and vitamins in your diet. Making your own dog food at home can definitely determine what you are feeding your dog. [first]

### 1.2 Give your dog an omega-fatty acid supplement. 

You can buy an omega-6 supplement or add safflower or sunflower oil to your dog's foods. If you choose to add oil, you can add 1 teaspoon each day for small dogs or 1 teaspoon for large dogs. Avoid giving your dog too much oil as it can cause diarrhea. You can also supplement with omega-3 fatty acids to help fight inflammation. Omega-3 fatty acids are found in flaxseed oil and fish. No matter what dietary supplement you give your dog, you should use the correct dosage indicated on the product's packaging.
- Omega fatty acids can reduce itchy skin if your dog is allergic because it is a fatty acid that has natural anti-inflammatory effects.
- Omega fatty acids also work to nourish the growing cells in the innermost layer of the dog's skin. It takes up to 28 days for these cells to move outside to form new skin for your dog. Therefore, you should not stop giving your dog fatty acids before this time. [2]

### 1.3 Groom your dog regularly. 

Every few days, you should brush your dog once, no matter how long or short it is. You can use a comb or brush to troubleshoot and remove dandruff and dead skin. Find a brush tool that best suits your dog's coat. You should use a brush deep into the dog's fur so that the natural oils are spread evenly over the hair and use a comb to untangle. [3]
- Grooming also helps to increase oxygen to the dog's skin, which in turn improves the dog's coat condition and health.
- You can rub a piece of dry skin on your dog's fur to increase its shine.

### 1.4 Bathe your dog with the appropriate shampoo. 

To prevent your dog's hair from losing its natural oils and drying out, don't use shampoo to bathe your dog more than once a month. Choose a shampoo that is specific to dogs and suitable for the sensitivity of the dog's skin and coat. For example, if your dog scratches a lot, you can choose a shampoo made for sensitive skin or made from oatmeal because oatmeal can provide natural itch relief. [4]
- If your dog likes to roll around in mud and needs regular bathing, choose the mildest and most moisturizing shampoo.
- The dog hair should be flushed with water. Residual shampoo or conditioner residue on the hair can irritate the skin, dull the coat and lose vitality.

### 1.5 Check for parasites. 

Look closely at the dog's coat for parasites that affect the dog's coat and overall health, such as fleas or ticks. Dog mites are usually larger and more slow than fleas, making them easier to spot. To check for fleas, turn the hair over with your fingers in certain areas of the dog's body (like behind the ears, below the back, near the tail, and on the belly). Look for small, pin-like black spots that are clustered together and called flea clusters.
- Should take your dog to the vet to test for worms or internal parasites. They can absorb all of your dog's nutrients and affect his coat. The veterinarian can examine the stool sample and prescribe medication to treat the parasites inside.
- There is a parasite (Cheyletiella) called "walking dandruff" because they look very much like a large piece of dandruff and can move if you observe carefully. Your veterinarian can check for the Cheyletiella dog beetle and recommend that you spray the dog's fur every 2 weeks for 2-3 treatments. [5]

## 2. Identify health and skin problems

### 2.1 Determine whether you are feeling unwell in your dog. 

If the dog is sick or feels nauseous, the dog may stop grooming. Dogs that do not lick hair will become dirty and messy, and this is a sign of illness that you should notify your vet. Inform your veterinarian if you notice any of the following in your dog: [6]
- Anorexia
- Constantly thirsty
- Vomiting
- Diarrhea or soft stools
- Smelly breath
- The ear smells
- Limp
- Shortness of breath

### 2.2 Check for signs of toothache. 

Toothache is the cause of difficulty eating in dogs. As a result, your dog will look messier and drop food on the fur. To check for signs of toothache, turn your dog's lips over to see the teeth and gums. White teeth and pink gums indicate that the dog's teeth are healthy and normal. If your teeth are covered with plaque, are loose, or your gums become inflamed and bleeding, you need to see your veterinarian. [7]
- You may also notice that your dog's breath smells bad and his eating habits become messy. If the tooth is damaged, the dog will spit the food out because it cannot chew. Dirty eating will make a dog's coat dirty.

### 2.3 Identify signs of arthritis. 

Arthritis is the cause of joint stiffness and pain. If the joints are stiff and painful, it will be difficult for a dog to groom himself. Dogs with arthritis often walk stiffly and have difficulty getting up and down stairs or jumping in a car. You need to take your dog to the vet to treat the pain of arthritis. [8]
- In addition, you should also help your dog brush when he has arthritis. Pay attention to areas where the dog is difficult to reach on the coat.

### 2.4 Check for greasy hair and flaky skin. 

Watch for flaky skin and dandruff, or if your dog's coat becomes greasy. Your dog may be suffering from increased sebum production - too much oil in the skin. Increased sebum production can cause peeling or dandruff. Your veterinarian needs to determine the cause of the oily or flaky skin to recommend treatment. [9]
- Your veterinarian may recommend giving your dog a vitamin A or zinc supplement to treat skin problems. [ten]

> Advice
- Flaxseed oil and fish oil are rich in omega 6. However, fish oils often have a "fishy" smell, so you may not want to choose this product to avoid bad breath from your dog.
- Be wary of over-the-counter medications if you suspect that your dog has an internal parasite. The medicine you buy can be toxic to your dog.
