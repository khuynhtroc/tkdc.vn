## 1. Help keep your dog calm at home

### 1.1 Act normally around the dog.

Pretend like there's no fireworks, just have fun playing with the dog. If it comes close, please caress and comfort it. If it isolates itself, hides and even groans, leave it alone. [first]
- Sometimes the dog may run away and hide in a cage or get under the bed. If it reacts like that, don't chase it, just check in for a long time.

### 1.2 Play music or white noise. 

Television sound is also very effective. These sounds do not completely overwhelm the fireworks, but can reduce the impact of the fireworks on the dog. However, do not play music louder than usual. [2]
- You can use an app like Simply Noise or Noisli to make a white noise.
- On video streaming websites, you'll find a list of soft music or background noise.

### 1.3 Close the curtains. 

The bright lights of the fireworks can also scare dogs. It will feel safer if you close all the blinds, curtains, or curtains. [3]
- You can also limit the effects of light by training your dog to wear an eye patch. However, some dogs are more frightened by the explosions of fireworks than from the lights, so whether or not the eye patch is effective depends on your dog. [4]

### 1.4 Distract your dog with a game or toy with a reward in it. 

The dog will not pay attention to the fireworks when it is busy with something. Play an indoor game with him, such as tug of war or throw objects, or give him a toy containing peanut butter or food to try to get the reward inside. [5]
- Food balls, “KONG” toys, or puzzle boards are fun activities to choose from.
- When your dog is stressed, don't give him the treat. It is important to keep it focused on one activity.

### 1.5 Dress your dog in a “lightning jacket”. 

A thunderclap is a special kind of coat that surrounds the dog's body. This shirt gently hugs the dog to help reduce stress. You can order shirts online or at pet stores. [6]
- You can also dress your dog with a small stretch shirt or t-shirt. The shirt you choose should fit, hug the dog closely and be worn backwards so that its tail sticks out towards the collar.

### 1.6 Make a dog stress jacket with an elastic bandage. 

This shirt has the same effect as a "lightning vest". You can use ACE dressing or other non-stick tape. First, place the tape head in the front of the dog's chest, under the dog's neck. Then, put the tape over your back, thread it under your front legs, and bring the tape up to tie on your back. You need the bandage to fit your hand, avoiding tightening the bandage too tightly. [7]

### 1.7 Use a leash if you take your dog outside. 

If you can, avoid taking your dog outside while the fireworks are on. Even in the yard, the dog can try to escape or jump over a fence. If you absolutely must take it out, you need to wire it in as soon as it's done. [8]
- The fireworks may stop firing for a while and then resume. Therefore, you should use a dog leash every time you go out on a fireworks day.

## 2. Take the dog to the cannon fire

### 2.1 Watch for symptoms of anxiety. The expression of stress in dogs is not the same as that of humans. Even if the dog sits obediently, he can be very anxious. Some signs of fear or anxiety include: [9]
Yawning constantly
Gasp
Drooling
Shivering
Licking the edge [10]

### 2.2 Always use a dog leash. 

Although your dog is very docile without leashes, fireworks can frighten him and run away. The leash will help keep it on during the artillery fire. [11]
- You will need to have your dog wearing a collar with a name tag, with your name and contact information. If the dog runs away, this information will help someone else take it home.

### 2.3 Give your dog a drink. 

When the dog is anxious, he often breathes quickly, so he needs to drink more water. You can pour the water into a glass, or if you only have a water bottle, slowly pour the water in front of the dog to let him drink the flowing water. [twelfth]

![Keep-a-Dog-Calm-During-Fireworks-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-calm-your-dog-in-the-presence-of-fireworks/v4-728px-Keep-a-Dog-Calm-During-Fireworks-Step-11.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 Walk your dog. 

You can take the dog for a walk around to release the energy that is causing it to worry. If the dog seems to want to go for a walk, take it for a while. [13]

![Keep-a-Dog-Calm-During-Fireworks-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-calm-your-dog-in-the-presence-of-fireworks/v4-728px-Keep-a-Dog-Calm-During-Fireworks-Step-12.jpg.webp)

### 2.5 Take the dog home if it is too stressful. 

In the end, if the fireworks are too stressful for the dog, and you cannot reassure him, take him home. [14]

## 3. Reduce anxiety before firing the fireworks

### 3.1 Give your dog plenty of food and water before the event. 

Once the firecracker starts to explode, the dog may not want to eat anymore, so feed it before dark. On the other hand, your dog will drink more water when worried, so keep a bowl of clean water handy. [15]

![Keep-a-Dog-Calm-During-Fireworks-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-calm-your-dog-in-the-presence-of-fireworks/v4-728px-Keep-a-Dog-Calm-During-Fireworks-Step-14.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Get your dog to exercise before the fireworks night. 

Exercise helps your dog release excess energy that can cause anxiety in the future. In addition, taking the time to let your dog go out first will also limit the need to let it go out during fireworks. [16]
- You should take the dog for a walk before dark and let him go to the toilet. That way it probably won't have a need to go out in the evening.
- Spend a lot of time playing with your dog that day. You can take him for a walk in the park or play a game of stick throwing in the yard.

![Keep-a-Dog-Calm-During-Fireworks-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-calm-your-dog-in-the-presence-of-fireworks/v4-728px-Keep-a-Dog-Calm-During-Fireworks-Step-15.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Create a shelter in your home. 

You can provide a few safe hiding places for your dog so he can hide in it if he is frightened. Dogs like to hide in narrow, closed, and dark places. [17]
- If you have a pen, put some old clothes in the cage to make it more comfortable, then cover with a blanket to increase a sense of cozy and safe.
- Your dog may hide under the bed or jump into the bath. You need to clean up these places and keep them open.
- If you don't want your dog to hide somewhere, such as a closet or in the basement, close the door and prepare another hiding place for it.

### 3.4 Turn on the recording to let the dog get used to the sound of the fireworks. 

Before the day of the firework, you should get your dog used to the sound of the firecrackers. You can buy CDs at a pet store or online, or you can also find fireworks displays online online. [18]
- Playing firecrackers regularly can help reduce your dog's sensitivity to loud noises.

![Keep-a-Dog-Calm-During-Fireworks-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-calm-your-dog-in-the-presence-of-fireworks/v4-728px-Keep-a-Dog-Calm-During-Fireworks-Step-17.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Consult a veterinarian if your dog has a history of stress. 

If your dog has had a negative reaction to previous fireworks, thunder, or loud noises, consult your veterinarian before the day of the fire. Your dog may be able to prescribe medication to help calm the dog during the event. [19]
- The drug commonly prescribed is a pheromone called Adaptil. This pheromone is available in the form of a spray, topical, and diffuser necklace.
- You can try another drug called Sileo, but this drug is only available in Europe. This is a medicine specifically designed for dogs that are sensitive to loud sounds like fireworks. [20]
- If you do not want to give your dog medication, you can ask your veterinarian to recommend some naturally derived supplements, such as Zylkene. These supplements also work very well.
- Your veterinarian can refer you to a qualified animal behavior specialist. A specialist can help train your dog to be less sensitive to loud noises. However, the training can take up to 6 months.

> Advice
- Don't scold your dog when he's worried. You yell, not reassuring, and only confusing it.
- Always wear collars and nameplates for your dog. If the dog runs away, someone can find it and return it to you. You should also consider adding a chip that tracks it.
- If everyone wants to see the fireworks, you should try to arrange a person to stay with the dog. It would feel better if someone stayed with them.

> Warning
- Fireworks are often launched on festive occasions, such as National Day, New Year and Mid-Autumn Festival. This is when the animal rescue centers are busiest because so many dogs run away from firecrackers and can't find their way home. You should keep your dog safe at home and keep an eye on it at all times.
