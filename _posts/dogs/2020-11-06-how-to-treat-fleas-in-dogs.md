## 1. Flea identification

### 1.1 Look for small red spots, flea droppings, and flea eggs on the dog's skin. 

One of the most questionable signs of a flea's presence are the marks they leave on the dog's skin. Look closely at the dog's skin for small, red, and swollen bites. In addition, fleas often leave feces that look like small dark sand grains and white flea eggs shaped like tiny grains of rice. [first]
- If the dog has an allergic reaction to the bite, the red area may be more widespread.
- If your dog has dark fur, use a flea comb to check for flea signs. Tap the white towel to see if there are any droppings or flea eggs.

### 1.2 Notice if your dog scratches a lot. 

Scratching, licking, and biting the skin too much is another obvious sign that your dog has fleas. Watch your dog's behavior to see if he suddenly becomes itchy, bites, or licks his fur more often than usual.[2]

### 1.3 Look for bumps and scabs on your dog's skin. 

Scaly, flaky patches and inflammation can be signs of a number of skin conditions, including fleas. If you suspect that your dog has fleas, look closely at the coat for swelling, patchy patches, or scaly spots.[3]
- If you notice any of these symptoms, call your veterinarian. In addition to a flea infection, the above symptoms may be a sign of ticks, scabies and other skin diseases in dogs.

### 1.4 Use a flea comb. 

If you suspect your dog has fleas, you can purchase a flea comb from pet stores. Use a comb to check for fleas and anything left behind. A flea comb can make it easier to identify fleas, eggs and flea droppings. [4]

### 1.5 Watch the adult flea jump on top of the dog. 

For a severe flea infection, you may see adult fleas jumping on the dog's back as the dog moves. You need to quickly bring your dog to the vet for treatment.
- The severity also depends on the dog, so don't panic. Your veterinarian will tell you how severe the condition is and prescribe the appropriate treatment.

## 2. Treating fleas

### 2.1 Check with your veterinarian. 

Before starting home remedies, talk to your veterinarian to make sure you're choosing the right product for your dog. The dose of medication to take depends on the size of the dog, and puppies that are too small or too young may not be suitable for some medications. Call or make an appointment with your veterinarian to make sure the flea medicine is chosen for your dog's needs. [5]

### 2.2 Use a flea bath oil. 

Flea bath oils are a quick-acting way to get rid of fleas in dogs. However, this is the first "line of defense" and will only work for about a week, so you should bring your dog to the vet for long-term oral medication treatment. Read the product's instructions to make sure you are using the correct dosage and the correct parts of your dog's body. Bathe your dog again according to the instructions on the package or as directed by your veterinarian.[6]
- Using too much topical flea medicine can be irritating and dangerous for your dog. Be careful about the dosage you use depending on the size and age of your dog.
- Use a flea comb to brush your dog after it has dried its coat to remove any leftover flea eggs.
- If used in the right dose, the bath oil will most likely not remain on your dog's fur, but you still need to rinse it off thoroughly after applying the bath oil.

### 2.3 Take a tick and flea prevention medicine. 

You can take the same flea repellant to get rid of fleas. It works more slowly, so it works best when used in combination with quick-acting therapies such as flea bath oils. [7]
- Topical medications like Advantage and a flea collar can both help control a flea infection.
- The flea collar is aimed only at adult fleas. You will still have to treat your dog with another medicine to treat the growing eggs and larvae, in case they are still alive after bathing the dog.

### 2.4 Get a doctor's prescription to treat a serious flea infection. 

If your dog has a flea infection that is terribly uncomfortable or the situation seems difficult to fix, see your veterinarian. Your doctor can prescribe medication to treat a persistent flea infection and to make your dog more comfortable. [8]
- Always strictly follow your veterinarian's instructions for administering the medication. Pay special attention to the dose, the time to use the drug during the day, how many times a day, and possible side effects.

### 2.5 Clean the home immediately to prevent reinfection. 

Wash dog beds, blankets, clothes and cloth toys in a washing machine, use a dog-safe laundry detergent, and leave a "clean" wash mode if available. Disinfect your dog's food dishes, plastic toys in hot water and dish soap. To get rid of fleas from floors or carpets, place a flea collar in the vacuum cleaner garbage bag and vacuum the areas where dogs normally live. Regularly dump garbage in a vacuum cleaner.
Dispose of your home immediately after an infestation to kill eggs and fleas that accidentally fall off and escape.

### 3.1 Regularly use tick and flea prevention products. 

You can find anti-tick and flea products in oral pills, topical treatments or necklaces at pet stores. Choose a therapy that's right for your dog and use it regularly. Give your dog medication and use topical medications as directed by your veterinarian or on the package. Likewise, the flea collar should be replaced according to the manufacturer's recommendation. [9]

### 3.2 Brush your dog's fur with a flea comb. 

Use a flea brush to brush your dog's fur regularly to handle fleas before they spread. You can brush your dog weekly to get rid of the fleas before they can lay eggs and multiply. [ten]

### 3.3 Wash dog utensils weekly. 

You should prevent dog fleas by cleaning the dog's bedding, blankets, food bowls, toys and clothes (such as sweaters). Use hot water and dog safe laundry soap to wash your laundry, and use the washing machine's “clean” mode, if available. Wash your dog's food dishes and plastic toys with hot water and dish soap. [11]

### 3.4 Keep your home clean. 

To prevent fleas in your dog, you need to keep fleas out of your home. Vacuum areas where pets often lie down, spray flea repellants or place flea traps around the house. This is especially important if your dog has been infected with fleas before. [twelfth]
- Appropriate measures to dispose of the home will depend on the specific environment. If your dog is frequently infected with fleas, you can choose a therapy such as a flea bomb to get rid of large numbers of pests quickly.
- Flea traps are a safe and effective preventive measure in homes where flea infections are under control.

### 3.5 Isolate pets infected with fleas. 

You need to prevent the spread of fleas among pets by separating those infected with fleas. You can keep an infected dog in a room and close the door so that other pets cannot get in. If the flea infection is severe in your home, you should keep the uninfected animals in a friend's house or in pet care until the flea condition is resolved at home. [13]
- Don't let quarantine turn into punishment. Make sure your dog has adequate food, clean water, and other amenities such as blankets, beds and toys. Take some free time each day to play with your dog as well. Your goal is to prevent a flea from spreading instead of ignoring the dog and making it feel self-pity.
- Always wash your hands and change clothes after you have come into contact with infected pets before letting other pets come into contact with you.
