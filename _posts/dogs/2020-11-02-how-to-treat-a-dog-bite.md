### 1.1 Check for the bite. 

Most dog bites are small wounds that can be treated at home. If the bite is just scratching the skin or the tooth imprint forms a shallow tear, you can treat it at home.[3]
- This is different from a deep wound in the tissue area, an open wound, or a crushed bone / joint. You must go to a medical center to treat these types of injuries, discussed in more detail in Step Two.

### 1.2 Wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water. 

Take a few minutes to wash the bite with soap and water at the right temperature.[4] This will help clear the wound from bacteria in the wound mouth or from the dog's mouth.
- Any soap can be used, but antibacterial soap is the best option.
- Soap and water will make you feel bad, but it's better to wash the wound thoroughly.

### 1.3 Press hard if the wound is bleeding. 

Use a clean washcloth or gauze to press firmly on the wound if it is bleeding after washing it off. [5] The bleeding will stop or slow down enough to cover the wound for a few minutes.
- If the wound continues to bleed a lot and makes it impossible for you to apply the dressing after 15 minutes of holding, you should seek medical attention. [6]

### 1.4 Apply antibiotic ointment. 

Antibiotic ointments like Neosporin or Bacitracin can help prevent infection as the wound heals.[7] Apply medication to the wound according to the instructions on the package.

### 1.5 Bandage. 

Immediately after applying the antibiotic ointment, cover the wound appropriately.[8] Cover the wound carefully to protect the wound, but don't be too tight as it may interfere with blood circulation or make you uncomfortable.

### 1.9 Determine your dog's rabies vaccination status, if possible. 

You can get rabies from a single bite. People who have been bitten by a dog need to find and determine if their dog bites has been vaccinated against rabies so that they do not have to worry about this issue. [13]
- If you cannot confirm whether the dog has been vaccinated - for example, it is a wild dog - you should observe the dog for 15 days (if possible) to confirm signs of rabies. You should also visit a medical center if you cannot determine the vaccination status of your dog.

- Diabetes
- Kidney disease
- Cancer
- HIV

### 2.1 Check for the bite. A serious bite is a wound that shows signs of cavities and can tear tissue.[15]Depending on the bite force of the dog, the bite may damage the bones, ligaments, and joints such as pain when moving, unable to move the area around the wound. If you notice any of the following symptoms, seek medical attention instead of home treatment:[16]
The deep wound sees both fat, muscle and bone.
A serrated bite or a distant nodule.
The wound bleeds a lot and cannot stop bleeding after 15 minutes.
The wound is 1-2 cm larger.
Wounds on the head or neck.

### 2.3 See a doctor. 

Your medical professional will determine the best method of treatment such as hemostasis and suture. The doctor will clean the wound (with an antiseptic such as iodine) and perform minor surgery if needed to remove dead tissue, damage and infection that could interfere with the recovery of other tissues.[18]
- Your doctor looks at the vaccination record to determine if you need a tetanus shot.
- If your doctor suspects that the bite was hurting your bones, you'll need x-rays to determine the appropriate treatment. [19]
- Tell your doctor if your dog has been vaccinated against rabies. If your doctor thinks you are at risk for rabies, they will vaccinate you. [20]

If the wound is at risk of infection, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics for you. [21]
- The most common antibiotic is amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin). Tablets are taken over a period of 3-5 days. The most common side effect is indigestion.

> Advice

- You can refer to articles on how to prevent dog bites online.

> Warning
- If the wound starts to itch and the skin around it becomes swollen, see your doctor.
- This article is for information only regarding the treatment of dog bites, and should not be taken as medical advice. See your doctor if you are unsure of the severity of the injury.
- If the wound gets worse, it's still better to see a good doctor.
- If you cannot determine if your dog has been vaccinated against rabies (through documentation whether it's your dog or someone else's), you need to go to a health center. Rabies can be cured if you go to a medical center right after a bite. You cannot wait for symptoms to appear to see a doctor. [23]
- A wound to a hand, foot or head requires better medical attention as the skin in these organs is very thin and can affect many joints. [24]
