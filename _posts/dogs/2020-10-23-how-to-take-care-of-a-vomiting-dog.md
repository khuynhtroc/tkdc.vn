## 1. Take care immediately after your dog vomits

### 1.1 Check for signs of shock. 

Dogs need immediate medical attention if there are signs of shock such as: 
- Light skin and gums
- Unusual behavior
- Fall down
- Attenuate
- Difficulty getting up and walking
- Reluctantly, cocked his head
- Boring

### 1.2 Keeps warm and makes the dog comfortable. 

After your dog has vomited, pat him so he knows he has done nothing wrong. Try to get your dog to lie down and rest. If your dog seems cold and shivering, you should cover the dog with a blanket, take care, and help run out of ink.
- You should help your dog feel comfortable. You can let the dog lie on the floor comfortably so that he won't try to get up or walk.

### 1.3 Wipe off the dog's fur with a warm, wet cloth. 

Dry vomit can cause the coat to become sticky, so be sure to remove the dog's fur immediately. You should only wipe off the fur when your dog is resting for a while, and stop wiping immediately if he becomes uncomfortable.
- You can place puppy pads or old towels under the chin and around the dog. That way, if your dog vomits, he or she should not contaminate the carpeting. Some dogs know that puppy pads are a place to go to the bathroom. This will make your dog less nervous about dirtying his house whenever he wants to vomit and find a place to vomit.

### 1.4 Watch for signs that the dog may regurgitate. 

You should watch closely since the first time your dog vomits, as persistent vomiting requires immediate medical attention. Signs that the dog has returned to vomiting include gagging, or making a sound as if something is stuck in the throat; stiffening, and walking aimlessly around. 

## 2. Be aware of emergency situations

![Care-for-a-Dog-After-It-Has-Just-Vomited-Step-5]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-a-vomiting-dog/v4-728px-Care-for-a-Dog-After-It-Has-Just-Vomited-Step-5-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Get treatment right away if your dog's belly is bulging. 

If the dog is constantly vomiting, the dog may experience bloating - a serious and life-threatening condition. The symptoms of bloating are trying to vomit but not being able to vomit and a lot of drooling (because the dog cannot swallow).
- Your dog needs immediate medical attention if the stomach is distended, as this is a serious condition and can kill the dog in just a few hours if left untreated.

![Care-for-a-Dog-After-It-Has-Just-Vomited-Step-6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-a-vomiting-dog/v4-728px-Care-for-a-Dog-After-It-Has-Just-Vomited-Step-6-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Watch for signs of dehydration. 

When vomiting occurs, your dog may feel nauseous and may not want to drink water. This, along with vomit fluids, can dehydrate the dog as the amount of water lost is greater than the water intake. When your dog is initially dehydrated, give your dog a mixture of electrolyte drinks mixed with water every few hours throughout the day. If your dehydration doesn't improve, take your dog to the vet. Look for initial signs of dehydration like Early signs of dehydration include:
- Panting continuously
- Dry mouth, gums, or nose
- Visible fatigue
- Eyes dry or sunken
- Skin loses elasticity (skin does not return to its original position as soon as you grip and release)
- The weakness of the hind legs (later stage dehydration)
- Unsteady walking (later dehydration)

### 2.3 Know when to take your dog to the vet. 

If the cause of the vomiting in your dog is simple and obvious, such as after the dog digs through the trash, focus on taking care of it at home and the dog can get better after drinking water and dieting. However, you should take your dog to the vet immediately if you experience signs such as:
- Gagging (not vomiting anything)
- Vomiting 1-2 times with sluggishness and weakness
- Vomiting for more than 4 hours or unable to drink water
- Vomiting of blood due to a severe ulcer in the wall of the stomach

## 3. Identify and rule out the cause of your vomiting

![Care-for-a-Dog-After-It-Has-Just-Vomited-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-a-vomiting-dog/v4-728px-Care-for-a-Dog-After-It-Has-Just-Vomited-Step-8-Version-6.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Distinguish between vomiting and burping to determine the right treatment. Dogs can also burp and push out indigestible food without any force on the abdomen or any signs of serious illness. When you burp, your dog simply lifts the food and relies on gravity to push the food down to the stomach. However, in the case of urgent vomiting (acute vomiting), the dog may be able to expel everything in the stomach due to the contraction of the abdominal muscles. You may see the dog flexing over to vomit and vomiting an unpleasant odor.

Heartburn is often an early sign of esophageal disease or digestive problems. For example, if you eat too much and too quickly, the burnt dog food is often undigested and in shape. 
- If you suffer from frequent heartburn, your dog may be suffering from a long-term illness, so place the dog food on a chair and take your dog to see the vet.

![Care-for-a-Dog-After-It-Has-Just-Vomited-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-a-vomiting-dog/v4-728px-Care-for-a-Dog-After-It-Has-Just-Vomited-Step-9-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Consider the cause of the vomiting. 

You should pay attention to your dog's recent diet, behavior, emotions, and environmental conditions to determine the cause of the vomiting. For example, you might recall the last walk to determine if the dog ate a scavenger or spoiled food. Vomiting can be a common symptom of "gut litter", in which the dog eats spoiled and unhealthy things, causing the dog's body to get rid of it. However, vomiting in dogs is also caused by other serious causes such as: 
- Gastrointestinal tract infections
- Intestinal parasites (helminths)
- Severe constipation
- Acute renal failure
- Acute liver failure
- Colitis
- Parvo disease (inflammation of the intestines-stomach)
- Cholecystitis
- Pancreatitis
- Ingestion of toxins
- Heat shock
- Uterine infection
- Drug reactions
- Cancer

### 3.3 Evaluate the frequency of vomiting. 

If the dog vomits only once, eats normally, and has normal bowel movements, vomiting is merely a malfunction (not for any other reason). If your dog vomits several times a day or lasts for more than a day, see your vet immediately.
- Persistent and repetitive vomiting in dogs should have a checkup at the veterinarian's office. Your veterinarian can diagnose the disease with a variety of tests such as X-rays, blood sample analysis, stool tests, urine analysis, ultrasound, and/or radiographs.

![Care-for-a-Dog-After-It-Has-Just-Vomited-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-a-vomiting-dog/v4-728px-Care-for-a-Dog-After-It-Has-Just-Vomited-Step-11-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Examine the vomit to determine the cause. 

Look at the vomitus for wrapping paper, plastic bag samples, and bone fragments (you should not give your dog real bones, as this is also one of the causes of vomiting) and inside. If you see blood in the vomit, get your dog to the vet immediately, as the dog is at risk of rapid, severe, and death of blood loss.
- If there is no foreign object in the vomit, you can see its shape and properties. Determine whether the vomit looks like undigested food or is liquid. Make a note of what you observe to tell the veterinarian when the dog continues to vomit. Your veterinarian can diagnose it if you provide pictures or samples of vomiting. Imaging can help your veterinarian quantify vomit and find the right treatment.

## 4. Diet after the dog vomits

![Care-for-a-Dog-After-It-Has-Just-Vomited-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-a-vomiting-dog/v4-728px-Care-for-a-Dog-After-It-Has-Just-Vomited-Step-12-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Avoid feeding your dog for 12 hours. 

Vomiting can irritate the stomach lining and make your dog vomit more if eaten right after. It takes time for your stomach to rest, and this can also help you determine if the cause of your vomiting is food. You should avoid feeding your dog, even if he appears extremely hungry. The fast is also an opportunity for your dog to get rid of anything that causes vomiting. 
- Puppies and puppies should not fast for more than 12 hours.
- If your dog is sick (especially diabetic), consult your veterinarian before fasting.

![Care-for-a-Dog-After-It-Has-Just-Vomited-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-a-vomiting-dog/v4-728px-Care-for-a-Dog-After-It-Has-Just-Vomited-Step-13-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 4.2 Give your dog a drink. 

Every 1 hour, give your dog 1 teaspoon of water / 0.5 kg of body weight once. You should continue to give your dog this drink throughout the day and night until he can drink the water as usual. Drinking too much water after vomiting can cause your dog to vomit again. On the other hand, a dog can become dehydrated if not given water. You should take your dog to the vet if he can't even drink this small amount of water.
- For example, a dog weighing more than 6 kg needs 12 teaspoons (¼ cup) of water every hour and day and night.
- Consider purchasing an electrolyte replacement drink such as Pedialyte or Lectade at a pharmacy or veterinary clinic. Follow the instructions on the package for how to make an electrolyte supplement with boiled water. This drink helps to soothe the stomach and fight dehydration. You should give your dog the correct amount of water as directed above. Note because not all dogs like the taste of this water and will drink it.

![Care-for-a-Dog-After-It-Has-Just-Vomited-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-a-vomiting-dog/v4-728px-Care-for-a-Dog-After-It-Has-Just-Vomited-Step-14-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 4.3 Add more water if the dog refuses to drink. 

To prevent dehydration, find ways to keep your dog hydrated. Consider dipping a towel in water and wiping your dog's gums. This will help cool the dog's mouth whenever he feels nauseous when he drinks. Or, you can let your dog lick the ice cube so that his mouth is wet and get a little water in his body. You can also try giving your dog warm ginger, chamomile, or peppermint tea to soothe his stomach and digestive tract. Like water, you should only give your dog a few spoons at a time.
- If your dog refuses to drink tea, you can try freezing the tea in an ice tray, then crushing it into pieces. Dogs can eat iced tea this way.
- Try to give your dog a variety of fluids until he finds the right one.

![Care-for-a-Dog-After-It-Has-Just-Vomited-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-a-vomiting-dog/v4-728px-Care-for-a-Dog-After-It-Has-Just-Vomited-Step-15-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 4.4 Feed the dog again. 

After 12 hours, you can start feeding your dog 2-3 teaspoons of low-fat, easy-to-digest foods. Lean meats like boneless chicken and hamburgers will provide your dog with the necessary protein. Meanwhile, boiled potatoes, low-fat cottage cheese, and cooked rice can make up for the full amount of carbohydrates your dog needs. You can mix 1 part lean meat with 5 parts carbohydrates. Make sure to give your dog food that is well-cooked, fat-free, and seasoned so that he can easily digest it instead of feeding him regular food.
- If your dog is not vomiting, give him some food every 1-2 hours. However, you should take your dog to the vet right away if the dog vomits again.

![Care-for-a-Dog-After-It-Has-Just-Vomited-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-a-vomiting-dog/v4-728px-Care-for-a-Dog-After-It-Has-Just-Vomited-Step-16-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 4.5 Slowly return to normal food. After the first day of bland feeding, mix the bland food with a little bit of common food for one meal. For example, start mixing at a 50/50 ratio for one meal, then gradually increase it to 3/4 of the regular food with 1/4 of the bland food. You can re-feed your dog normally afterward if the dog no longer vomits. Always be sure to follow your veterinarian's advice and have your dog re-examined if necessary.

Stop feeding your dog if the dog regains vomiting and see the vet immediately. It is best to keep a record of what you feed your dog and drink, its food intake, and behavior. This information is very useful for veterinarians.
- You should not test dog food or medicine as this can make vomiting worse.
