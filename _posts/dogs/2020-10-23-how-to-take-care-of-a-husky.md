> Huskies are very active breeds, which means they need to run and be active every day to be happy. [1] They are loyal and good-natured dogs and love life, and many people want to keep their husky. However, sometimes they are stubborn and difficult to train, so you need to be ready for each task. If you are going to have a husky, see if you have the time, patience, energy and dedication to give them a long, happy and fulfilling life.

## 1. Train your Husky

### 1.1 Help your Husky settle in. 

Social inclusion teaches puppies to interact appropriately with many aspects of the environment (e.g. people, fellow humans), which helps them develop into a confident and well-mannered dog. Allow your puppy to spend time with different people and experience a variety of sights and sounds. [2]
- Puppy training is a great way to teach your young husky how to interact with other dogs. [3] Introduce your dog to the training class when he is 4-5 months old. [4]
- Alternatively, you can help settle your dog by taking on different situations in the environment, such as the sound of the car moving and the siren. You can invite friends over to let your dog get used to meeting new people. [5]
- Taking your puppy to the park is also a great way to expose him to a variety of people, sounds, and scenery.
- Watch your puppy explore new worlds. If your dog is scared or alert, don't try to force him through the situation.

### 1.2 Join an adult Husky in an obedience training class. 

By nature, the Husky is an extremely independent and intelligent dog. [6] However, they are sometimes very stubborn, [7] making it difficult to train. Command training is best for a Husky. [8]
- Enroll your husky in "young" command training when they are 4 months old and follow up on adult training when they are 12 months old. [9] For your husky to obey, it is best to train them from a young age.
- Be careful Husky can use his intelligence to distinguish the training class from the house, maybe they perfectly demonstrate the training exercise in class, but when they come home they will not obey. [10] If this is the case, then you need to continue giving your dog home practice.

### 1.3 Train your husky in a cage. 

This is especially important if you have a puppy. The cage training helps to facilitate the home training process, they will not urinate or defecate where they sleep. [11] In addition, cage training will make the cage a safe place to live when they feel scared or need to rest. [twelfth]
- Your Husky's cage is not a penalty site. [13] Putting a puppy in a cage when disobedient can cause him to develop in a negative way with the cage.

### 1.4 Leash training. 

If you release the chain, husky will run away or chase something in the distance. [14] They love their master, but if given the chance they still prefer to run and chase (hunting instinct). [15] Therefore, leash training your Husky is important.
- Leash training will prevent your Husky from pulling on the leash. If they start to pull the chain, you can either stand still or call them back, or quickly go in the opposite direction. [16]
- Do not pull or reverse the leash, as this will cause your Husky to pull harder.
- Do not use an elastic leash, this may cause your husky to pull harder, as tugging will help him go further. [17]
- If you have a puppy, let him sniff it and "explore" the leash and collar in the house before you take him outside. [18]
- An obedience training class can help you teach your Husky to use leashes.

### 1.5 Establish that you are the commander of your Husky. 

A Husky is a sled dog and always has a leader to guide the way. [19] You need to make your Husky see you as a guide. The best way to establish a commanding relationship is to keep your dog waiting for a meal. [20]
- When controlling the meal, your husky will treat you as its sole source of food and resources, just like the commander. [21]
- Another way to form a commanding relationship with your husky is to walk the dog at your disposal. [22] As you go ahead, you show confidence that your husky is following you, rather than letting it drag you around.
- Don't be too surprised if your Husky tries to be the leader. If your dog has such a tendency, you need to be determined and consistent with your commanding relationship. [23]
- A commanding relationship can not be established by bullying or beating a dog. [24] Your husky will not trust you and respect you as a leader if you try to establish the relationship through physical threats.

## 2. Exercise and Play with your Husky

### 2.1 Exercise with your Husky every day. 

Husky is a working dog native to Siberia, where they have to pull heavy sled for long distances. [25] So they need daily exercise (at least 30-60 minutes) to release energy. [26] [27]
- Hiking is a good exercise for your Husky. [28]
- To encourage the "working" side of your Husky (and if you're adventurous), tie a leash to your bike or wheelbarrow for the dog to pull. [29] Don't try this if your dog is not properly trained.
- Playing a plate or rock climbing with your Husky is also a great way to release your dog's energy. [30] [31]

### 2.2 Make a protective fence to prevent the dog from escaping. 

Husky is the master of "escape". [34] If you let your dog run and jump in the backyard, make a fence so that the dog won't escape. [35] That's not enough, if your husky likes to dig soil, he can escape by digging a secret tunnel. [36]
- To prevent the dog "digging" from escaping, you should put the fence a few 10cm deep into the ground. [37] You can place concrete or a net under the fence to prevent your dog from burrowing. [38]
- Contact your fencing company to design your fence so that your dog cannot hide out.
- If your husky is still able to dig the hole, you can pour coal into the hole so the dog cannot continue digging. [39]
- Always observe your husky when releasing it in the backyard. Even though they like to run and jump outside, if left alone in the backyard, they will feel lonely and bored, and start digging for vandalism. [40]

### 2.4 Do not allow your husky to exercise in hot weather. 

Husky has a thick coat to adapt to cold weather. [44] This does not mean that you should not keep your husky if you live in a warm environment, but you need to pay extra attention when it comes to playing and exercising in hot weather.
