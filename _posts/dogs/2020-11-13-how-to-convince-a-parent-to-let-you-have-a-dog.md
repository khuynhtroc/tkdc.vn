> You are eager to raise a puppy, but sometimes it's hard to get your parents to agree. Getting the permission of your parents, you can start by highlighting the benefits of keeping a dog, such as friendship and affection. Next is to show maturity and responsibility by doing odd jobs in the house. Think about taking care of a pet to show your parents that you are ready to own a dog.

### 1.1 Talk about the dog as a family 'darling'. 

Tell your parents that the dog will make you spend more time at home, and will also spend more time with them. Tell the whole family that it's more fun to raise a puppy - go for a walk in the park or roast in the yard, enjoy the barbecue while playing a plate with it. [first]
- Describe a warm family dinner with a dog sitting beside you, or a scene where the whole family is together watching a movie and the dog is at your feet.

### 1.2 Tell your parents that your dog will make you go out more outdoors. 

Do your parents often complain that you are alone in a dark room and glued to your computer screen or playing games? Do parents often encourage you to go out and enjoy the sun? If so, say that raising a dog will make you go to the park, sunbathe and exercise more instead of all day texting with friends or eating fast food. [2]
- Add that your puppy will force you to take off your headphones and play simple children's outdoor games with your four-legged friend.

### 1.3 Explain that having a dog can help improve mental health. 

Breeding dogs is a remedy, and dog owners often live longer and happier lives. Your dog knows when you are upset and soothes you when it is stressed. A dog is an animal with good intuition, and it knows how to comfort its owner. If your parents are busy at work, tell them that a puppy in the house can not only comfort everyone but also be friends with you when they are away. [3]

### 1.4 Tell your home it would be safer to have a dog. 

Dogs have a guarding instinct, and they will do everything they can to keep those they consider their family safe. With good training, your dog will know who is welcome, and who cannot enter the house. [4]
- Breeders are generally less at risk of being robbed. Explain that a trained dog will be not only your companion but also your "bodyguard". If you've grown up so your parents can go on vacation without taking you with you, say that you'll feel more secure with it around.

### 1.5 Tell your parents that the dog will teach you to be more responsible. 

While it's a good idea to show your parents that you are capable of keeping a dog by being responsible, you can add that keeping a dog will make you even more responsible and careful. State the reasons as follows:

- Keeping your dog will make you go to bed early and wake up earlier to take the dog outside. There will be no more scenes where you stay up until 3 a.m. staring at the TV screen or computer screen.
- Your dog will teach you the value of responsibility in other things.

### 1.6 Talk about the breed of dog you want to keep. 

Learn to identify the breed you want to keep and why. Regardless of whether it's a small dog like the Miniature Schnauzer or a big dog like the Labrador, you need to explain why you want to keep. This way, your parents will find that you spend a lot of time and energy thinking about raising a dog. When telling your parents about this, you may need to add:
- The advantages of the breed. Are they famous for being easy to train, absolutely loyal, or having a great look?
