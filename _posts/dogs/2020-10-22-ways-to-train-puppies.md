## 1. Proficient in basic training

### 1.1 Be willing to take responsibility for your puppy. 

Keeping puppies can be fun, but you should also define your family member's duties when it comes to puppy training, as well as some rules for them. Training methods are important and not just for puppies.
- For example, if your puppies are required to sleep in the cage until they are trained to use the toilet, tell people not to let them sleep in the bedding for a few nights.

![Train-Your-Puppy-Step-2]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-train-puppies/v4-728px-Train-Your-Puppy-Step-2-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.2 Be clear with your puppy's rules. 

They need to know the specific rules on their first day in their new home. You should come up with an easy-to-do rule. For example, if you don't want the puppy to climb the stairs, you can install a barrier on the stairs to block them. If you don't want your puppies to ask for food from the table, don't give them your food. Be careful not to scold your puppy too much, as it will make them less confident in you.

![Train-Your-Puppy-Step-3]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-train-puppies/v4-728px-Train-Your-Puppy-Step-3-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.3 Reward it deserves. 

You cannot train puppies without rewarding them. Most puppies respond quite well to a treat. However, be aware that when training comes with a food reward, or "junk food", you should only reward small treats, or daily chunks of food!
- Giving your puppy a lot of treats every time she rewards her will have a negative impact on her health as well as make them overweight. You should use high-value rewards when training new cards, for example turkey is good for dog health, and low-value foods, such as dog food when retraining. Oldest.
- Some puppies respond well to toys. You can reward your puppy with a catch-up game by throwing the ball away every time he has a good behavior, or if the puppy likes something else, try tug of war. However, rewarding with toys takes longer, and can cause the puppy to be overly excited about training, or become bored over time. Toys often work when training for quick reflexes, although this training can only be used when puppies are 18 months old because their bones and joints could not adapt to this training. .

### 1.4 Study specific breeds of dogs. 

Each breed of dog has different characteristics, so you should research the breed to determine the requirements for them. Each breed needs its own training to develop fully, so it's important to be aware of your puppy's specific needs.

![Train-Your-Puppy-Step-6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-train-puppies/v4-728px-Train-Your-Puppy-Step-6-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.5 Praise your puppy. 

In addition to giving rewards, you need to incorporate some more compliments for them. When the puppy responds correctly, use a friendly tone in high tones. They often respond to a soft, cheerful voice.
- Switch training is also quite effective. To use this form of training you should buy a switch, and every time you give a command, you need to press the switch immediately.
- However, when your puppy is disobedient, use a stern tone of voice to reprimand him. Puppies need to distinguish between a soft, cheerful voice and one that tells them they have done something wrong. If you are forced to reprimand, try soothing your puppy after every time you scold him.

![Train-Your-Puppy-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-train-puppies/v4-728px-Train-Your-Puppy-Step-7-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.6 Shorten training time with each session lasting about 10-15 minutes. 

In addition, keep training sessions that include lots of new and fun content, for example some games that you create yourself. If your puppy begins to feel bored, distracted, or upset, stop training and take a break.
- If your puppy starts to feel uncomfortable, stop training here. However, you should end with compliments and reward them. This way the puppy will get excited for the next training session.
- Train for at least 10 to 15 minutes each day to help your puppy learn new commands faster.

## 2. Train your puppy to go to the toilet

![Train-Your-Puppy-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-train-puppies/v4-728px-Train-Your-Puppy-Step-8-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Start toilet training in the right place when you bring your puppy home. 

Note that puppies 12 weeks or younger often cannot fully control their bladder or bowel. Even when they want to "hold on" they still cannot do it, so you should not be harsh when they walk around the house. Most puppies pick up all the toilet training at six months, and in some cases take longer.
- When you are training your dog to go to the bathroom, keep a positive attitude even when you encounter a disturbing incident.

![Train-Your-Puppy-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-train-puppies/v4-728px-Train-Your-Puppy-Step-9-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Remember the one hour a month rule. 

Puppies are generally only able to refrain from defecating for a period corresponding to their number of months of age. If your puppy is four months old, he or she can only hold for up to four hours. [first]
- It is not necessary to apply the above rule at night, as puppies do not poop at night like humans. At four months of age, they will sleep until morning without having to deal with their sadness.

![Train-Your-Puppy-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-train-puppies/v4-728px-Train-Your-Puppy-Step-10-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Schedule regular feeding. 

As you can see, puppies deal with their sadness after eating. To speed up your toilet training, feed them at a fixed time of the day and stick to that schedule. Unless recommended by your veterinarian, you should not “open-feed” (keep food available regularly.)
- Adoption will prevent your puppy from going to the bathroom at a fixed time and not see you as a food provider (factors that play an important role in teaching your puppy that you are in power. and take responsibility.) [2]
- Do not give your puppy treats between meals.

![Train-Your-Puppy-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-train-puppies/v4-728px-Train-Your-Puppy-Step-11-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 Take the puppy out often. 

Puppies usually need to go to the toilet every 30-45 minutes. You should schedule a time to take them out. Puppies should be allowed out every hour, as well as after eating, sleeping, and playing. Every morning what you need to do is take them outdoors first, and before going to bed, and before you leave them alone for long periods of time.

![Train-Your-Puppy-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-train-puppies/v4-728px-Train-Your-Puppy-Step-12-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.5 Praise your puppy every time they poop outside. 

Give your puppy treats and praise them when they deal with their sadness outdoors. You should take your puppy to the same spot to let him know this is the place to poop. When you take the puppy to this position, give the command to "go to the bathroom" and wait for it to do so. [3]
- Getting your puppy to a stationary position helps them associate the smell of waste with the act of defecating. The characteristic odor may encourage the puppy to defecate in this place.
- Stay with your puppy while they are being pooped so you can praise him for the right time when he is pooping. Keep in mind that some dogs will deal with their sadness as soon as they go out, while others need to sniff around and play for a while before going to the toilet.

![Train-Your-Puppy-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-train-puppies/v4-728px-Train-Your-Puppy-Step-13-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.6 Watch for signs that the puppy needs to poop. 

Some common signs include sniffling, running around, moaning, leaving the room and pacing. When you notice these behaviors, take the puppies out as quickly as possible and watch them carefully.
- If you notice your puppy is starting to poop indoors, clap your hands vigorously twice. This action will startle them and immediately stop defecating in the house. Get the dog out quickly by using a leash or encouraging it to follow you.
- Once outside, keep the puppies in place and let them go to the toilet on their own. You can then praise them and offer them a treat. If the puppies do not excrete waste, you should not be too worried, just lead them to this position when they have the need to deal with the sadness next time.
- Do not scold and rub your puppy's nose when he is messing. You just need to clean up and try to get them out next time.

![Train-Your-Puppy-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-train-puppies/v4-728px-Train-Your-Puppy-Step-14-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.7 Create a 'safe haven' for your puppy. 

This is especially important when you're away from home. Choose a crib or area that can be fenced off with a small gate and clean up your furniture in this area. Spread newspaper and place bedding, toys and food and drinks on it. Over the course of a few weeks, you should notice the puppies begin pooping in a fixed location in the area. [4]
- You can reduce the amount of newspaper spread on the floor so that the puppy can determine where the cover is for the toilet. Then you can slowly move the newspaper to another place near the entrance and the puppy will continue to deal with the sadness there.
- If the puppy walks around instead of using the designated position, you may have reduced the amount of newspaper too much, or moved it too quickly away from the original area. Toilet training takes a long time, so be very persistent.
- Praise your puppy every time they go to the toilet in the right place. If they move around but you can't see them, then don't scold them. Puppies don't understand why to be blamed for an action taken an hour ago. If you catch a puppy's puke, keep it in that position and say “no” firmly.

![Train-Your-Puppy-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-train-puppies/v4-728px-Train-Your-Puppy-Step-16-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.8 Allow the puppy to access the rest of the house. 

Once your puppy has gotten into the habit of using his own 'toilet', you can let him explore the rest of the house. You need to give them room-by-room access and only do so when you can watch the puppies. Whenever you cannot supervise your puppy, take it back to the 'safe haven.' [5]
- Have the puppy wear the leash every time he explores the new room. They will not be likely to cause a problem if you control the top of the chain.

## 3. Train your puppy to stop biting and nibbling

![Train-Your-Puppy-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-train-puppies/v4-728px-Train-Your-Puppy-Step-17-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Realize that your puppy won't hurt you when he bites you. 

Puppies love to use their mouths to explore new worlds, so they will bite you during their exploration or play. Puppies don't know that their teeth are as sharp as razors and are able to stab the skin when they bite, so that's why you should train your puppy not to bite as a child.

![Train-Your-Puppy-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-train-puppies/v4-728px-Train-Your-Puppy-Step-18-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Train your puppy to use gentle force. 

Puppies are not aware of whether they are biting hard or lightly. When playing with your puppy, you can allow him to gnaw his skin in case he has engaged in this behavior. If your puppy bites hard, you need to shout or shout 'Wow!' This will startle them and stop biting you. [6]
- Ignore your puppy for 10 to 20 seconds after he bites you, or leave for 10 to 20 seconds. Then go back and continue the game. If the puppy continues to bite hard, shout "wow!" again and ignore them for about 20 seconds. This helps your puppy realize that if he bites lightly, continue playing, but if he bites hard, stop playing here.
- Once your puppy stops biting the pain, you can start training him not to bite the pain. Repeat the above steps when your puppy bites you a bit. Continue the exercise until they are just biting lightly or not touching your skin.

![Train-Your-Puppy-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-train-puppies/v4-728px-Train-Your-Puppy-Step-19-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Prevent the puppy from nibbling on your feet. 

If your dog likes to lie on its feet while you are walking, you can bring a toy in your pocket. Once your puppy starts to nibble, stand still, then take out your toy and wave in front of him to get attention. When your puppy starts to nibble on the toy, you can move on. Eventually, they will find that grabbing a toy is more fun than gnawing the owner's leg. [7]
- If you don't have a toy with you, stand still when the puppy starts to nibble. When they stop, praise them and get them a toy.

![Train-Your-Puppy-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-train-puppies/v4-728px-Train-Your-Puppy-Step-20-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Prevent your puppy from chewing on furniture. 

When you see your dog grabbing things such as shoes, furniture, or socks, take them away and reprimand them with words. Instruct your puppy to move on to chewing on other objects, such as toys, and praise them when they start chewing on them. This step helps your dog see what is possible and cannot be chewed.
- If your puppy continues to chew on the items in the house, use a flavor repellant, such as a bitter apple, to prevent them from chewing on them. You can buy a flavor repellent at a pet store. Bitter apples work well because this unpleasant taste will prevent the puppy from chewing on the furniture immediately.

## 4. Train your puppy to follow basic commands

![Train-Your-Puppy-Step-21]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-train-puppies/v4-728px-Train-Your-Puppy-Step-21-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Train your puppy to sit down. 

Every dog ​​needs to know this command. If you want them to be obedient, safe, and able to learn a lot of complex commands, you need to train them to sit first. [8]
- Have snacks ready. You need to use treats to teach this command, unless the dog doesn't like to reward it with food.
- Puppies need to be leashed so that you can adjust their behavior.
- Keep the treat in front of the dog's nose. You can gently pull the chain up while pointing the treats up, but still close to their nose.
- The puppy will lift up according to the reward, and automatically switch to a sitting position. If not, gently push the dog's torso down. As soon as they are seated, you can give the command "Sit!" Then reward the puppies and praise them.
- Repeat steps often and be patient. Some dogs take a longer time to absorb than others. After the puppy recognizes the word "sit," simply say that word just before he is ready to sit. With time, perseverance and practice, your dog will be able to obey the command to sit well.

![Train-Your-Puppy-Step-22]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-train-puppies/v4-728px-Train-Your-Puppy-Step-22-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.2 Train your puppy to lie down. 

After learning the command to sit, they need to learn the command to lie down. Start by telling your dog to sit down. This time you should also prepare your reward and bring them chains to control their movements. [9]
- Keep the treat so your dog can see it right in front of his nose. You can kneel to lower yourself.
- Apply force to the leash so the puppy cannot reach the reward, move the reward closer to the ground. Then the dog will lie down to access the food.
- If this doesn't work, you can put more pressure on the chain. Pull the necklace down, while moving the reward. Once the puppy is lying down, say "lie down" and reward it.
- You can then give the command "lie down" just before the puppy starts to lie down. Continue to practice the steps so they learn to lie down when they hear the command.

![Train-Your-Puppy-Step-23]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-train-puppies/v4-728px-Train-Your-Puppy-Step-23-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.3 Train your puppy to stay close. 

This is one of the major safety commands. You need to be in control of your puppy and know that he will come back when told to him.
- Bring leashes to your puppy. Ask them to sit or lie down. Take a few steps away and get on your knees. Take your favorite toy with you.
- Call out your puppy's name in an excited tone of voice to encourage your puppy. Do not apply force to the chain. Show your puppy your toy. Pat your knees. Continue the conversation in a cheering tone.
- When the puppy starts to approach you command "Come here!" As they approach, you can praise and reward them.
- Continuing the training, take a few steps slowly.
- Once the puppy has mastered the command, you can try calling out its name while it is playing.

![Train-Your-Puppy-Step-24]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-train-puppies/v4-728px-Train-Your-Puppy-Step-24-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.4 Train your puppy to stay in position. 

This is also an extremely important safety order. Puppies need to know how to sit still. This is indispensable when they go for walks, play outside, meet people and other dogs, etc. [10]
- Give the puppy a leash. This time you don't show them the reward, but be prepared to reward your puppy in the right time.
- Ask the puppy to sit down. Issue the command "Sit still" firmly. Hold your hand in front of the puppy at a height above his head. Keep your hands where your dog can see them. Don't move your hands until they master the command. This helps the puppy to focus and recognize commands.
- Step back slowly while maintaining eye contact with the puppy. If the dog starts to move, give it a stern command in a loud voice, "Ah ah!" This helps the puppy focus on his attention and realize he did something wrong. Don't be discouraged if your dog is still unsure of the commands. Instead, be firm but gently put them back in their original position, again in a sitting position. The puppies should stay there or will assume they can move on, even while still sitting still. Repeat the command and try again.
- When the puppy is sitting still, you can say "Okay!" And allow the puppy to stand up and come closer. Praise and reward your dog.
- Continue to do the training. After the puppy has mastered the command, you can move further away and ask him to wait until you give permission to change his position.

![Train-Your-Puppy-Step-25]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-train-puppies/v4-728px-Train-Your-Puppy-Step-25-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.5 Train your puppy to obey other commands. 

Once your puppy has learned the basic commands and has mastered following commands consistently and quickly, you can teach them to do another "more complex" command. You can consult many books and some articles online to find new commands to train your dog as well as effective communication methods.
- Teach your dog to roll. Friends will be quite impressed and surprised when the puppy looks so cute when it rolls back and forth.
- Teach your dog to beat hands. You should engage your children in this training and allow them to train the dog to do actions that you both enjoy.
- Teach dogs to "doggie" dance. What could be more adorable than seeing your puppy dance?
- Teach your dog to shake hands . Shaking hands is the basic tactic all dogs need to know.
- Teach your puppy to play with throws. Puppies are always full of energy. You can train them to play this game to burn their body energy

![Train-Your-Puppy-Step-26]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-train-puppies/v4-728px-Train-Your-Puppy-Step-26-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.6 Consider having your dog participate in training courses. 

This helps puppies learn from their friends, and their owners, as well as learn in a more entertaining environment. You can find puppy training classes through your veterinarian, extension service, or your local pet store.

> Advice.
- Don't call your puppies closer to punish them. This will cause your dog to associate access to punishment, scaring him off and distrusting your call.
- Conduct indoor training until the puppy understands the command, and is more focused and calm. Then move outdoors with a variety of entertainment elements, but still have them on a leash or in an enclosed area for safety.
- Start the training session right before feeding the puppy. They will see the act of eating as a reward.
- If your puppy is less attentive and becomes bored even if the training session is not long, you can let him play a game during training. Some games include hiding rewards and asking your puppy to find, play with objects, and any fun and creative games that both you and your puppy enjoy.
- Only train one dog at a time (if you have a lot of dogs) so it will focus on you.
- Prevent the puppies from accessing the baby's room, especially if you have babies. Animals tend to be conscious around young children and won't bite them, but you should still keep the puppies apart. When allowing your puppy to play with children, watch for any signs of resistance.

> Warning. 
- Do not use an object to beat your puppy. This only makes the close relationship between humans and dogs formed so long ago to become broken.
- Be gentle and careful when pulling on the leash to instruct the puppy in a new position, such as "sit" or "lie down." Don't tug on the leash, just pull it gently so the puppy knows what to do. If the puppy starts to struggle or has difficulty breathing, stop acting, and gently push the puppy's hips down.
