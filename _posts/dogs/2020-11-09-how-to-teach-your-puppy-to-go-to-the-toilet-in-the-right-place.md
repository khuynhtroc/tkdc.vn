> The puppy you just brought home is sure to delight the whole family, but a new pet showing up in the house poses many challenges. One of the first and biggest challenges you may face is teaching your dog to poop in the right place. Some puppies learn fairly quickly, but others struggle with it. While training your dog, you should always be patient, calm, and consistent. If you are positive and follow the instructions below, then toilet training is a small matter.

## 1. Understand the basics

### 1.1 Introduce the puppy to the new home, to you and your family, and to its new role. 

Similar to when you go to a new place or join a new group, your puppy can be very curious, excited, scared or happy. Now is the best time to have a good and friendly relationship between you and your dog. For your new home puppy learning to trust and respect people, it is important that you set what to expect from your puppy and always come first.
- Show the puppy where he is allowed to go. At first, do not let your new pet go home freely to roam and explore everywhere, especially when you do not want them to live in those places. For example, if you do not want to let your dog go upstairs and into the bedroom, close the door and do not allow the dog to explore.

### 1.2 Understand the behavior and needs of your breed. 

Find out the characteristics, special needs, or behaviors of your breed. For example, if your puppy is a tiny chihuahua, it will need to pee more often because of a small bladder; crashes will still occur from time to time, even if the dog is well trained.
- Almost all breeds of dogs are very intelligent, but they do not think like humans. Problems often arise when you expect them to understand simple commands or tell you when they need to pee or urinate. For that reason, you will have to understand how they communicate with you and the signs they represent and perceive in you.

### 1.3 Keep an eye on the dog. 

When petting puppies, it is best to keep your dog in an area where you can always keep an eye on it. So you can immediately recognize the signs that the dog needs to go to the toilet and promptly prevent the problem. Signs that your puppy has a need to poop is that he will start walking around, scratching and sniffing.[first]
- Some signs to look for in your dog are whining, walking around, sniffing, barking, or any change in behavior. Take your dog outside as soon as you notice one of the signs.

![Potty-Train-a-Puppy-Step-2]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-your-puppy-to-go-to-the-toilet-in-the-right-place/v4-728px-Potty-Train-a-Puppy-Step-2-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.4 Prevent crashes. 

When you see your puppy pee or have a bad bowel movement indoors, make a sudden sound, such as clapping your hands and say "no," then quickly take the dog outside.[2]
- You have to startle your dog, but don't scare him. The goal here is to get your dog's immediate attention and know that you won't let him roam indoors. If you want consistency, you should use only the same word and / or the same sound every time.
- You may not get any results if your dog is pooping, as most puppies will not be able to stop the bowel movements halfway through. However, you should still do this as part of the training.
- Never punish your puppy for problems. A puppy usually doesn't know it's doing the wrong thing. Don't force your puppy to smell or reprimand him for his actions. They will not remember and may be afraid of you.[3]
- Using punishment to stop the puppy from defecating in the house can confuse him and even make the situation worse. Your dog only understands that you get angry when it comes to the bathroom and will hide you when it needs it, and it will most likely make dirt in places that are difficult to clean.

### 1.5 Choose a place for the puppy to poop. 

Ideally, choose an area outside of your home and take your dog there whenever it needs to. Consider places where other dogs are not in sight and easy to clean. [4]
- Your dog will remember the smell of urine and will begin to refer to that area as the "restroom."
- Choose a place that can be reached quickly and easily. You will have to go there regularly during training.
- Before your puppies get their third vaccination, you should avoid places where other dogs go or have just gone, such as parks. You should also talk to your veterinarian about this.
- When you let your dog go out, it's best to use leashes to teach your dog to defecate in specific locations. That way you can also make it easier to watch and know when it's done. [5]

### 1.6 Select a specific sound or voice command. 

Every time you take your dog out to his toilet, say "go" or choose another command to teach him to get in the right place. [6]
- Your dog will begin to recognize the command and understand what you want it to do. This will help your dog know where and when he has to pee or poop.
- Use this command only when you want your dog to poop to avoid confusion.

### 1.7 Praise the dog when it is correct. 

Always praise your puppy every time he defecates in the right place with a cheerful tone to let him know he's pleased. [7]
- When praised regularly, your dog has a source of spiritual encouragement to keep on doing its job.

### 1.8 Turn toilet time into a relaxing and pleasant event your dog looks forward to. 

To encourage your dog to wait patiently for you to allow the poo, you must first make him enjoy this.
- Getting out for a walk and “releasing the sadness” should be a pleasant experience that every dog ​​loves.
- Do not interrupt when the dog is using the toilet in the right place. You need to let your dog relax, relax, and "free up."
- You can also give your puppy a small reward later to encourage him or her.[8] However, this can distract some dogs.

![Potty-Train-a-Puppy-Step-6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-your-puppy-to-go-to-the-toilet-in-the-right-place/v4-728px-Potty-Train-a-Puppy-Step-6-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.9 Clean up as soon as the problem occurs. 

When your dog accidentally contaminates your home, it is important to clean it thoroughly quickly. This will help prevent the dog from continuing to use the place as the restroom.
- Use an ammonia-free enzyme cleaner. You will get rid of the smell and keep the dog from being attracted to the area.[9]
- The urine has a strong smell of ammonia that will attract dogs to smell and also leave a trail of them. So some of the pads used to teach your dog to go to the toilet spray ammonia may encourage the puppies to go there.
- You can also use white vinegar to deodorize ammonia.

## 2. Watch the puppies

![Potty-Train-a-Puppy-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-your-puppy-to-go-to-the-toilet-in-the-right-place/v4-728px-Potty-Train-a-Puppy-Step-7-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Limit where your dog can live. 

It will be easier to keep an eye on the dog by showing the dog in certain areas of the house. You can do this by closing the door or using a baby barrier. [ten]
- When you keep your dog in a smaller space, you will be able to observe at all times to know when the dog needs to go to the bathroom.
- The housing area should be large enough for your puppy to play with, but small enough for you to see at all times. A small room or a separate corner in the room is ideal.
- Remember to choose an area with a quick and easy exit. The room with the door leading directly out is best.
- Choosing a place that is easy to clean is also important. Problems are most likely during the early stages of training.

![Potty-Train-a-Puppy-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-your-puppy-to-go-to-the-toilet-in-the-right-place/v4-728px-Potty-Train-a-Puppy-Step-8-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Tie the puppy with a short leash. 

You need to leash your dog while indoors so that you can move more freely while still watching the dog. [11]
- When leashing your dog, you can move from room to room and take the dog with you. That way you will always be on the lookout for it.
- Having a leash on your dog also means you can get the dog out faster when needed.

![Potty-Train-a-Puppy-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-your-puppy-to-go-to-the-toilet-in-the-right-place/v4-728px-Potty-Train-a-Puppy-Step-9-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Use a kennel when you are unattended. 

When you are away or can't watch your dog, a crib can be an effective way to teach your dog to use the toilet. The puppy will learn to treat the crib as its "home" and will not want to contaminate its home. [twelfth]
- The crate should be large enough for the dog to stand up, lie down, and turn his head. If the crib is too large, the dog may use one corner as the "toilet" and another to sleep. [13]
- If the crib is large and the puppy is small, you can put it inside the crate to create the right space.
- You can give your dog a treat or toy to keep your puppy happy in the crate. [14]
- Limit the amount of time the dog stays in the crate to no more than four hours in a row. If your dog is young the time in the crate should be much shorter. Puppies under 12 weeks of age have a very small bladder and may not be able to control urination well. [15]
- In general, puppies can hold urine for an hour each month before they reach adulthood. [16] As such, if your puppy is only a month old, don't leave it in the crate for more than an hour.
- When you get your dog out of the crate, take him out immediately. Before your puppy knows how to use the bathroom in the right place, it will be easier to watch and train if you keep your dog in an area. This also helps to prevent dog contamination. [17]

## 3. Creating a habit

![Potty-Train-a-Puppy-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-your-puppy-to-go-to-the-toilet-in-the-right-place/v4-728px-Potty-Train-a-Puppy-Step-10-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Do it consistently. 

Consistency is one of the key things about toilet training. When taking your dog outside, it is best to pass the same door every time. You should also always lead your dog to the right spot and use the same voice command to help your dog relate the area to the proper action.
- Make a routine of taking your dog outside. Do this first thing in the morning and after every meal. Get the dog out every time you go home or get it out of the crate. Let your dog go outside after playing or drinking, after taking a nap, and just before going to bed. [18]
- With a puppy too young and early in training, you can also try giving it out every 20 minutes when possible. This way you can avoid the crash and have plenty of opportunities to compliment your puppy for getting in the right place. [19]
- Regular walks can also encourage the dog to poop properly.

![Potty-Train-a-Puppy-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-your-puppy-to-go-to-the-toilet-in-the-right-place/v4-728px-Potty-Train-a-Puppy-Step-11-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Find out how many times your puppy needs to poop. 

Pay close attention to the number of times your dog needs to pee. This will help you get to know your dog's habits and guesses when he needs to go outside. [20]

![Potty-Train-a-Puppy-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-your-puppy-to-go-to-the-toilet-in-the-right-place/v4-728px-Potty-Train-a-Puppy-Step-12-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Set a time for the dog to go outside around its meal time. 

Regular meals can help your dog get into the habit of going to the toilet regularly.[21] Puppies usually need to go to the toilet right after eating.
- Taking your dog outside after each meal will help reinforce the dog's notion of where to go and will also help keep your house from getting dirty.

> Advice
- In the early stages, it is possible that the routine of defecating is not well known. This is especially true for very young puppies. At this stage you may find your puppy "acting" in a place that is not allowed. In such situations, whether your dog pee or pee, you need to act consistently.
- You can also use an indoor puppy training mat. This product often has a smell that encourages dogs to pee in it. This is also a supportive way to pooch your puppy, and may also be necessary depending on your situation. However, this can also cause problems that make the training time longer and more difficult. The use of the mat can cause the puppy to mistake it for toileting in the house.
- As mentioned above, someone would recommend puppy littering, but if you use this product your puppy may assume he is defecating indoors. Don't use a puppy litter!
- Suppose you often praise your puppy for the correct behavior during training, then unexpectedly it causes a problem. Don't compliment the dog right away. Instead, take the dog outside and wait for it to go to the bathroom. When you're done, take the dog into another room in the house while clearing the dirt. Then try to be dissatisfied with the dog, but only take a few minutes. Make sure both you and your puppy are happy with training.

> Warning
- Your puppy can be in danger if you leash it unattended.
- There are many health problems that can interfere with toilet training. Dogs with a urinary tract infection will urinate often with little amount of urine and are difficult to control. You may also notice them licking the genital area. If there is a change in the dog's stool, the cause is likely gastrointestinal disease. Some of the most common causes in puppies are intestinal parasites, ingesting foreign food, or sudden changes in diet. If you need to change your dog's food, do it gradually over 5-7 days. If you suspect any of the above, you should consult your veterinarian.[22]
- Behavioral problems can also affect the success of toilet training. Urine marking is a normal behavior for the dog to raise its legs and pee in an area or object. A puppy with segregated anxiety syndrome can walk indoors when you leave it alone. Some puppies get nervous or upset when their owner is away. Others experience the urge to urinate when they are happy or excited. This makes them incontinence during certain activities. If teaching your dog to pee has not been helpful, discuss these with your veterinarian or dog trainer.[23]
