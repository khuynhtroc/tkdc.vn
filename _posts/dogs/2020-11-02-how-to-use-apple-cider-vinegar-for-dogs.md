A bladder stone can block your dog's urethra (urine tube) and limit the dog's ability to urinate. This is a critical condition that requires surgery right away. [twelfth]
- Apple cider vinegar is definitely NOT recommended for use in animals with a history of oxalate bladder stones. In theory, you can monitor the pH of your urine with a test strip. The ideal pH is usually around 6.2-6.4. If the test strip shows an acidic pH (below 6.2) then it's best to stop using apple cider vinegar until you have restored to a healthy pH. [13]
