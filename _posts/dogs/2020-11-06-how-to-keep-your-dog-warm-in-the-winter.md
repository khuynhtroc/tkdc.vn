During the freezing days, dogs feel as cold as humans, especially when the breed is not cold tolerant. However, some other dogs have a better cold tolerance than humans. To keep your dog warm in winter, you need to be aware of its origin and health, and be aware that you need to take the time to protect your dog in cold weather.

## 1. Take care of your dog in the cold season

### 1.1 Proper hygiene for the dog . 

Do not trim, shave, or trim your dog's fur, as the coat functions to keep the body warm. You need to follow the principles of proper hygiene, grooming and thorough handling during the winter, as the messy hairs are not enough to protect the body from snow and cold rain, and do not effectively insulate. [1] Proper hygiene can help prevent dandruff in the dry winter if your pet has this problem.

### 1.2 Bathe your dog indoors. 

The dog should be completely dry before going out. Bathe little in winter, or even skip this cleaning procedure. You should be aware that the dog's coat is very dry during the cold season. This helps them avoid a serious cold.
- If necessary, take a quick bath with warm water and dry quickly. Do not bathe in cold water as this will cause your pet to shiver, and low temperatures will make it difficult for your dog to warm up.

### 1.3 Trim the hair around the leg pads. 

This helps to prevent ice and snow from accumulating between the underline. [2] After taking a walk outdoors, check the soles of your dog for cracks, scratches, and foreign objects. If possible, protect the soles of their feet by applying vaseline or E45 to moisturize, but still be careful where the foot stain gets around the floor!
- If your dog is not wearing shoes, wipe off the salt and any chemicals that melt the snow after each walk; The chemical can be toxic and the salt will cause irritation.

### 1.4 Do not overfeed your dog. 

Your dog needs regular and quality food during the cold season to store energy and body heat. However, dogs generally do not need to eat much during winter. Otherwise they will be overweight.
- You should only feed your dog a lot if he or she lives outdoors and is active in winter. Talk to your veterinarian about your dog's specific energy needs.
- Always provide your dog with enough clean, non-frozen water inside and outside the home. You can purchase a thermos flask for outdoor use.

## 2. Keep your dog healthy in winter

![Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-5]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-keep-your-dog-warm-in-the-winter/v4-728px-Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-5-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Prevent winter disease in dogs. 

Like humans, dogs can get sick in cold weather, especially colds or caused by weather conditions. Some common illnesses include respiratory infections in humid climates, frostbite necrosis, and poison absorption.

![Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-keep-your-dog-warm-in-the-winter/v4-728px-Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-6-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Keep the dog warm and dry. 

This helps prevent respiratory infections, such as crib cough (like a cold in humans). If your puppy has respiratory infections, you should see your vet immediately. Note that if there are many dogs in the house, such as a kennel, the disease can spread more quickly. [3]

![Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-keep-your-dog-warm-in-the-winter/v4-728px-Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-7-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Freeze necrosis can be a problem in some dogs, especially hairless breeds. 

Examine the top of the ears and tail. If these parts are cold, white, red, or gray, and / or dry and hard, it could be signs of necrosis. [4] [5]
- If you suspect signs of necrosis, cover your dog's limbs with a blanket or towel to slowly stay warm, and then see your veterinarian immediately. [6]

![Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-keep-your-dog-warm-in-the-winter/v4-728px-Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-8-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 Store harmful chemicals used in the cold season out of the reach of dogs. 

The antifreeze has an unusually sweet taste for dogs and will lick it if they can reach it. Just four teaspoons of tea can kill a dog weighing less than 5 kg. [7]
- If your dog has ingested the antifreeze, get it to the veterinarian immediately as it takes a few hours to treat the pet.
- Another poison used during the winter is the rat trap. Used in large quantities because people are close together in winter. Keep all harmful chemicals out of reach of dogs and other pets, and remove any leaking fluid immediately.

![Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-keep-your-dog-warm-in-the-winter/v4-728px-Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-9-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 2.5 Note your dog's current condition. 

Arthritis and osteoarthritis can become severe during the cold season. Talk to your veterinarian about medications, treatments, and ways to keep your pet healthy and warm with arthritis in cold weather.

![Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-keep-your-dog-warm-in-the-winter/v4-728px-Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-10-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.6 Take short walks in inclement weather. 

Do not take your dog for walks like in warm weather. Short walks will still provide enough exercise and relief without making your dog (and you) cold.
- Even when you are indoors you should still exercise your body. Play indoor games with your puppy, such as throwing plates, tug of war, hiding toys, and if possible allow your pet to run around. Encourage your dog to run up and down stairs to practice agility. Note that if your dog has joint or hip problems, he or she cannot run, so only allow him to walk up and down stairs.

![Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-keep-your-dog-warm-in-the-winter/v4-728px-Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-11-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.7 Note that the rock is prone to slipping for dogs and humans. 

Ice skating can be stressful and sprained, so don't encourage your dog to play on the ice, especially games like disc throwing.
- Keep the dog away from frozen pools. The ice seems sturdy, but if the dog falls it can drown. Unfortunately, the person who saved their pets also drowned. So no matter how difficult you are, don't try to save your puppy.

![Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-keep-your-dog-warm-in-the-winter/v4-728px-Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-12-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.8 Wear a leash on your dog when walking in cold weather. 

If something goes wrong, such as a blizzard, or an iceberg suddenly appears, or if your dog falls into a lake, you won't be able to save your puppy. Always carry your phone full of battery in case you or your pet has trouble calling for help.

## 3. Prepare a shelter for your dog to live outdoors in the winter

![Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-keep-your-dog-warm-in-the-winter/v4-728px-Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-13-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Understand your dog's susceptibility to cold weather. 

Some dog breeds are not cold tolerant, while others are well adapted to cold weather. Dogs that cannot tolerate the cold should stay indoors. However, even cold-adapted dogs require heating and shelter in order to survive like outdoor dogs.
- Good cold-tolerant breeds include the Alaska Malamute, Siberian Husky and Chow Chow. [8]
- Dogs that are poorly adapted to cold weather include Doberman, small dogs, short or hairless dogs, and Greyhound (greyhound). In addition, dogs that have been heavily shaven or trimmed fall into this heading because their coat functions to keep their body temperature.

![Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-keep-your-dog-warm-in-the-winter/v4-728px-Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-14-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Prepare a shelter. 

Ideally, the dog should stay indoors during the winter, only going out to exercise and grief. This helps ensure that your dog does not get cold while you are away from home or sleeping. Puppies should not be outdoors because they are not able to keep themselves warm like adult dogs.
- If you have a dog that lives outdoors (such as a sled dog), make sure you have a place to live and a mattress inside. Spread fresh straw to insulate the cold ground inside your dog shelter. [9] Replace straw regularly.
- Outdoor dog accommodation requires a steep roof, insulation and heat, especially in very cold climates. [10] When it rains, the doors need to be shielded so that the rain doesn't fall inside.

![Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-keep-your-dog-warm-in-the-winter/v4-728px-Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-15-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Ensure the accommodation is well insulated. 

When preparing an outdoor shelter, you need to erect an artificial floor 10 to 15 cm from the ground. Spread insulation such as straw or wrap a bubble under the space so that cold air does not rise. You can place a hot water bottle under a fake floor to provide heat on harsh cold days.
- On the top of the fake floor, make sure you have a mattress for your dog. In addition to your mattress, spread more thick straw on the floor. Spread straw at least 15 cm thick, line it around the wall, and add a thin layer of straw so the dog can curl it around and make a nest to snuggle. This will help keep your dog's limbs warm and limit the wind blowing.
- Note that if you find the evening temperatures too cold, the dog accommodation may not be warm enough.

![Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-keep-your-dog-warm-in-the-winter/v4-728px-Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-16-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Shield the wind from draining into the accommodation. 

Wind is the agent that enhances cold weather conditions. You need to take good care of your dog that lives outside. If they are in the crate, you should install a porch at the door to reduce the wind blowing into the crate. Determine the direction of the wind blowing and rotate the door to the opposite side. You can then insulate the surroundings of the crib, especially the air inlet, to minimize heat release. To determine the effect of cold winds, you can find out on the meteorological website. [11]

![Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-keep-your-dog-warm-in-the-winter/v4-728px-Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-17-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Bring entire flocks of outdoor dogs indoors if the weather becomes extremely severe; the shed can also be warmer than your dog's outdoor shelters. 

Note that the more layers of insulation, the warmer the accommodation will be. Consider covering the shelter with a blanket and then spreading more plastic cloth for added protection.

![Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-keep-your-dog-warm-in-the-winter/v4-728px-Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-18-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.6 Check the crib daily to make sure it is dry and airy. 

Wet cold carries more risks than dry cold. Also make sure that the nest is warm enough and dry. Dogs lying on a dirty mattress will get sick and get dermatitis.

## 4. Keep your dog outside in winter

![Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-keep-your-dog-warm-in-the-winter/v4-728px-Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-19-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Keep the nest warm and put it in the proper position. 

The litter box plays an important role in keeping it warm during winter. If your dog is lying on the ground or in another location with openings, lay the mattress on the floor. Do this by placing the mattress on a low floor, lifting it a few inches off the ground. The purpose is to prevent heat loss when it comes into contact with the ground.
- Craft your floor by placing a pressed wooden board on several books or bricks.
- Prepare a bedding by using a mattress, blanket, and old clothes to keep warm.

![Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-keep-your-dog-warm-in-the-winter/v4-728px-Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-20-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.2 Provide heat on cold nights. 

This is especially important for older dogs and arthritis sufferers. Consider using a dog heating pad or hot water bottle. [12] Once the dog is comfortable with the nestling, he will accept and even want to enter it at night. [13]
- Older dogs often have stiff bones in the cold season. You should keep the joints warm so they feel comfortable, or cover them with a thick blanket after the dog goes to sleep.
- If your dog is past the chewing phase, you can use a bag of cherry seeds and warm it up to keep the joints warm. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, heat up the pack and place it on your dog's hard or swollen joints, then cover him with a warm blanket to make it more comfortable. [14]
- There are many types of electric blankets or heating pads nowadays, and a new type of mattress being researched is a baby blanket. They function to keep the puppy warm and provide heat that is safe enough to be exposed to over a long period of time. When choosing a hot mattress, you should read the instructions carefully to see if your pet can lie directly on the mattress without getting burned. Some animal-designed cushions are not safe when lying in person and require an additional barrier to prevent burns. [15]

### 4.3 Clean and change drives regularly. 

This will help prevent fleas, microorganisms, and dirty soil. This is especially important during winter, when the insects seek warm shelter.

![Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-22]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-keep-your-dog-warm-in-the-winter/v4-728px-Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-22-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.4 Use special clothing designed for dogs under certain circumstances. 

This type of clothing helps the dog feel warm in the cold winter. They are particularly suitable for small breeds, dogs without long hairs (eg, greyhounds and greyhounds), and old or sick dogs. [16] A common sign of a puppy in need of clothes is shivering, just like humans. [17]
- You can buy or make your own (knitting, embroidery, crochet, or sew) warm coats and clothes for your dog. For wet winters, you should add a waterproof layer, but make sure your dog can breathe.
- Let clothes air dry before allowing them to wear them. If your dog wears wet clothes outdoors, the cold wind will evaporate the water and lower his temperature, making it colder. You should have plenty of clothes to replace during washing.
- If possible, undress your pet while indoors unless the indoor temperature is too low. If your dog is dressed for the whole day, he or she will not notice any effect when going outside.

![Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-23]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-keep-your-dog-warm-in-the-winter/v4-728px-Keep-Dogs-Warm-in-the-Winter-Step-23-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.5 Use fur shoes to protect your dog's feet when walking on snow and salt. 

The salt irritates the dog's feet, and the snow feels very cold. Fur shoes help keep warm and avoid contact with salt that causes irritation. However, unless you have trained dogs to wear fur shoes from a young age, some dogs will not wear them.
- If your dog is having trouble wearing shoes, you should use aggressive reinforcement training. Put one shoe on one leg, reward the food, then take off the shoe. Repeat daily and gradually increase the number of shoes until the dog gets used to wearing them. [18]

> Advice
- Place a hot water bottle under your dog's nest to warm it up quickly.
- Avoid letting your dog go out in the cold. If your home has a separate pet door, or a dog entrance to keep it out of the cold, you should still keep an eye on how much time your dog has been out in the event that the dog has been outside for too long.
- If you feel cold, so does the dog. So when setting up a sleeping place for your pet, you have to choose a place where you will also feel warm.
- Before you coat your dog, it is recommended that you put it in the dryer 10 to 15 minutes in advance. This helps to increase the temperature of the jacket and makes the dog feel warm when he is outside.

> Warning
- Never leave your dog outside in the winter. Dogs need time to adapt to the change in temperature. If you want to leave your dog outside in cold weather, adapt it in the fall to get used to the temperature changes and stimulate thicker coat.
- Do not leave your dog outside for too long in cold weather.
- Do not leave your dog in a cold car. When the heater is turned off and the temperature drops rapidly, the car is like a refrigerator and the air is not only not circulating but also very cold.
- If your dog falls into a lake or glacier, call for help. Do not risk yourself to save the dog. [19]
