> The Sibir (or hereafter referred to as Husky) is a beautiful, independent, active and intelligent breed. Although this breed has a gentle temperament and affection, training a Husky is not easy. Husky dogs have a pack habit, so they will always challenge your "leadership" position and your limit. Your husky will be destructive if not allowed to exercise. To avoid undesirable experiences of keeping a husky, it is important to understand his temper so that training is appropriate for all situations.

## 1. Train your husky

### 1.1 Let them know you are the "leader. 

“Husky is famous for being difficult to train. They are pack dogs with a clear command hierarchy, so they are stubborn, fierce, and independent. If your husky is not properly trained, some of the breed's natural traits will make them particularly destructive. Therefore, it is important to minimize the bad behavior of your husky early and establish the foundation of an obedient dog. [first]
- It is important to understand the temperament of a Husky dog. Confidence and determination are important qualities for a husky breeder to obey the dog. Your husky will only respect or obey the order of "leader."
- Treating your husky equally is not a good idea, as husks are hierarchical dogs that only obey commanders. You must prove yourself in command at all times, as shown by eating first, stepping through the door before the dog comes in, or making the dog out of the way. It is very important to establish such hierarchical relationships.
- Sometimes your husky will become aggressive in order to attack a commander by biting, showing attitude, or exhibiting other aggressive behavior. In this case, you are forced to show your dominance as the "leader" to restrain them. Ignoring or allowing your husky to continue such behaviors will only encourage the dog to become more aggressive towards other dogs as well as with everyone.
- Husky will sometimes have instinctive behavior towards them but annoying people. Being the "leader" gives you the right to train your husky not to engage in bad behaviors, such as jumping on top of others, digging holes, biting and nibbling. Your husky will only obey the "leader".

### 1.2 Reward good behavior. 

Good manners are the foundation of a good dog. Using good food and a positive tone of voice is a good combination to help your dog repeat good behavior. This is called "positive reinforcement" or "respect training." [2]
- Give it a treat to let your dog know what behavior to repeat. Delaying too long will confuse your husky. Once the dog has learned a command, you no longer need to reward the gift.
- Redirect bad behavior into good behavior. Attract your dog's attention from being offensive to obedient. This helps the dog understand what can or cannot be done without punishment.
- Encouragement and rewards are safe as your husky will not be frightened, aggressive, or stressed about being hit. Instead of being violent towards your husky, just get your reward back if the dog makes a mistake.
- Keep the exercise simple and set goals. Your Husky, like any other animal, has a learning rate. Start with small commands, then gradually increase the complexity and reward your dog at all stages.

### 1.3 Punish your husky in a non-violent manner. 

Along with praise and rewards, husky dogs also need to be punished for bad behavior. Similar to rewards, corrective action should be taken immediately, consistently, and aimed at encouraging dogs to perform well. To avoid violent abuse of a dog against a dog that leads to a dog's involuntary obedience, control the dog's sources of joy, such as gifts, toys, play, and petting until the dog overcoming behavior. [3]
- Be determined to discipline the dog. Use statements like "no" or "stop" in an assertive tone but not anger.
- At all times, be sure to remain in command as a leader by tightly controlling training and commanding the dog.
- A given order must be obeyed. If your husky does not obey, walk away, leave the dog alone and do not give the dog what it wants. After a few minutes, give the command again - be patient and patient until the dog submits.
- If the dog continues to be stubborn and disobedient despite the command many times, put the dog in a “penalty spot” where the dog cannot come into contact with anyone until it has stabilized.

Establishing a routine is the best way to maintain consistency. The schedule is good for both the dog and the owner, as a schedule that specifies the time to train, play, go to the toilet and exercise will maximize the amount of contact time between the dog and the owner, while reducing Lighten your expectations. [5]

### 1.7 Outside of playtime, make sure your dog is active for at least thirty minutes a day to burn off excess energy. 

Remember that huskies have been trained for several hundred years, if not thousands, to become a sled dog, that has built up stamina in them. Lack of exercise not only makes the dog obese and lazy, but also provides an incentive to vandalize, such as running away, howling, gnawing, complaining or digging holes. [6]

### 2.1 Introduce the dog to the crib. 

You must not use a crate to punish your dog, do not treat the crate as a restrainer, jail or place where the dog cannot come into contact with anyone. Instead, let your husky comfortable with the crate by leaving the doors open. Always use a gentle and rewarding tone of voice when your dog is in the crate or near the crate, helping to keep him from feeling scared. Avoid forcing or tricking your dog into the crate.
- If your husky refuses or is afraid to step into the crate, put some delicious food in the crate as encouragement. Let the dog find the food itself. Repeat a few times a day as needed. [7]

At the end of the day, place a familiar treat inside the crate and close the door once the dog is inside. To reduce stress, place an interesting new toy inside the crate to distract your dog from the closed door. Continue to stay with the dog outside the crate until the whining or pooing has stopped. Keep your husky inside the crate until it has been quiet for at least 30 to 60 seconds. Avoid getting your dog out of the crate before the quiet time is reached, or you can order him to stay quiet.

### 2.4 Leave the house without taking your Husky with you. 

This is not a special case; Instead, leave when the dog is not looking, helping to keep the dog from panicking.
- Practice until it becomes a habit. Increase the amount of time you spend pretending to leave the house during training until you reach the two-hour threshold. Remember, if you have a puppy, they need to be pooped every four hours. So during training, schedule a time to go home or ask a neighbor to open the crate door for the puppy to go to the bathroom.
- It is a good idea to notify your neighbor that you are training your husky to use a crate, as your husky will "howl" a lot when it feels lonely.

### 3.1 Build mutual respect between your dog and children. 

Huskies are generally quite child-friendly, but they need certain limits - no jumping, grabbing, chasing, running, or pulling. Young children need similar limits - no teasing, rough behavior, chasing, plucking, tail or ear grip, or tug of war. [8]
- Children should also assist in training their husky under adult supervision so that the husky becomes comfortable and familiar with all family members.
- Teach your child to gently caress and touch a husky, instead of holding the fur or hitting the dog. Help your child build a trusting and loving friendship with your dog.

### 3.2 Identify potential risks. 

In addition to bringing your dog home, you should also consider whether the new environment is unfamiliar to your husky when there are young children. Find out if a Husky has been raised and acquainted with a child before you bring it home. Check to see if the dog has received any training in communication with the child. Watch when the dog is around the baby to see if the dog is uncomfortable, stressed, or growling. [9]
- Husky has an instinct to hunt small prey and sometimes even children. If your husky considers small animals, such as cats, to be food, they may mistake the baby or infant as part of the pack (family) and mistakenly attack them.
- Always keep your dog on a leash when you have young children, so that you stay in control and prevent injury.

### 3.3 Recognize your dog's body language. 

Some young children cannot understand the meaning of dog body language unless they are taught to recognize aggressive behaviors. Angry dogs will often bark, growl, bared their teeth and stare at the subject. Children should never have access to a dog in these situations. Instead, the child should immediately stand still, stand up straight, arms down to the sides and close their legs, turning away to avoid direct eye contact. If the dog is still attacking, the child should sit on the ground, with pillows close to chest, using arms to cover the face and fists to cover ears. Respond by keeping quiet. [ten]

### 3.4 Help your Husky get ready for your new baby. 

Training should start a few weeks or months before picking up the baby. Obedience training - from sitting, stern, lying down, to approach - should be done immediately and continuously until you can trust your dog.
- Pre-train at home with the doll to simulate new situations, scents and sounds, if it is necessary to train your husky to obey. Make sure you are not immediately reassured about the safety of your dog. If your husky does not obey orders completely and often, it is best to seek the help of an expert or training school.
- To avoid jumping, sniffing, or general aggression, the mother should see her Husky first for a few minutes without a baby until the excitement subsides. This also provides an opportunity for the dog to smell a new smell on the mother's clothes. Once your husky has calmed down, you can introduce your baby.
- It is natural that you will pay more attention to your new baby than your dog. However, don't neglect your dog or make it jealous. Prepare in advance by gradually decreasing interest in the dog a few weeks before picking up your baby.
- Babies are different from babies. Dogs usually treat babies as humans, but babies can be different. Observe the dog's "normal" behavior and reactions around young children. Check to make sure the dog is repeating the same behavior with infants. [11]

> Advice
- Maintain your dog's focus and dynamism through several short training sessions throughout the day instead of one long training session. This method also helps control the dog's behavior, keeps the dog focused and non-destructive.
- A Husky is not a good watchdog. They will get excited when their friends come over and will probably let you know. Apart from that, they are completely indifferent because strangers are not part of their pack, and therefore are not worth their attention.
- Husky dogs are fugitive artists. Unless you know very well where your dog is, you may want to build a 2.5 meter tall fence around the house. When you don't, your dog will be delighted - even laughing if he knows how to laugh!
