title: "How to calm a male dog when a female dog is in heat?"
summary: Male dogs are more likely to be attracted to female dogs during heat because they are biologically programmed in response to a bitch's scent. Keeping a male dog next to the female dog during the heat is stressful for both puppies. You should separate the male dog from the female dog and create a safe, relaxing environment for them. If you are keeping a couple together, you can avoid having sex. In addition, both should be sterilized to reduce the risk of unwanted pregnancies as well as prevent certain types of cancer and make them behave better.

## 1. Separate the male dog from the female dog

### 1.1 Separate the male from the female until the female is out of the heat. 

The only way to keep the male dog calm is to separate it from the female since he cannot control his actions when the bitch is around. Keep the male dog indoors or keep the barn if the female dog is outside, which will prevent the male from smelling the female.
- Don't take male and female dogs for a walk or let them play together.

### 1.2 Keep two dogs in a separate room. 

If you have a pair of dogs in the same house, keep them in a separate room as far away as possible so that the male dogs won't smell the female. Lock them in separate rooms, close the door, and don't let both of them out at the same time.
- Make sure there are no female dogs or toys in the male dog's room, as they will smell. Smelling female dogs from these objects causes the male dog to groan, howl, or scratch the door.

### 1.3 Keep the female dog indoors and the male dogs outside if the space is limited. 

If you do not have many rooms or limited space, you can keep the female dog indoors and the male dogs in the yard until the end of her heat period. Make sure your yard has a fence so that the male dog won't escape.
- This is only a good choice when the weather is fine and local laws do not prohibit keeping dogs outside.
- Don't keep the bitch outside while she is in heat, as she may escape and find a male to mate.

### 1.4 Keep the male dog in the cage until the female dog has stopped being in heat. 

While it is okay to separate two dogs in your home, you may not be able to control the dog's bullying behavior. In that case, it is best to limit the range of the male by keeping the coop for the end of the female's oestrus, usually around 3 weeks.
- You can prepare this by familiarizing the male dog with the kennel environment. You can place a large crate for the male dog in advance during the heat.

## 2. Set up a relaxing home environment

### 2.1 Spray methanol on the bitch's tail to drown out her scent. 

Vick's spray or other methanol sprays are a good choice and can mask the scent of a bitch. Spray the female dog several times a day to calm the male dog if you both live in the same house or area.
- Avoid letting your dog lick the medication by luring it out with toys or food while it waits for it to dry completely.
- This medication can be uncomfortable for your dog, so consult your veterinarian before using it.

### 2.2 Play with both dogs separately during the splitting time. 

Keep both entertained and forget about being in heat by playing with them. Have the female dog in a room with a gnaw toy while taking the male dog outside to play.
- After spending time with the male dog, switch to playing with the female in the room while keeping the male dog outside in the fenced yard.
- Try to balance playtime with two dogs, in separate areas, so that you both relax and calm down.

### 2.3 Take the male dog for a regular walk. 

Stick to a schedule for the male dog's walk, making sure the dog gets adequate walks depending on breed and size. Going for regular walks keeps the male dog away from the female dog and helps to reduce energy consumption when going home.
- Avoid taking the female for a walk in the heat, as she can interfere with the male dog nearby. Show the female dog to go outside to play in the fenced yard and watch so she won't run after any passing male dogs.

## 3. Sterilization of male dogs

![Calm-a-Male-Dog-when-a-Female-Is-in-Heat-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-calm-a-male-dog-when-a-female-dog-is-in-heat/v4-728px-Calm-a-Male-Dog-when-a-Female-Is-in-Heat-Step-8.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Talk to your veterinarian about sterilizing a pair of dogs.

Sterilization of both has yielded beneficial results. Usually, veterinarians will recommend sterilization of males within 6 months of age because they have low mating dynamics and low testosterone levels. Sterilization also helps them reduce the risk of disease and prevent cancer. Female sterilization helps prevent cancer as well as breast lumps. It is best to sterilize the bitch before she is in the heat for the first time, although you can also have surgery when she starts in heat.
- Remember that sterilization does not prevent a male dog from reacting to a female dog, only partially tame. You will still need to separate the sterile male dog from the female dog just in case.

### 3.2 Do not feed your dog for 8 hours before surgery. 

The clinic will give you some pre-operative instructions, usually not to eat or drink for 8 hours before surgery. The anesthetic will make the dog nauseous, so it is best to leave the stomach empty according to the procedure. You can still give water in moderation.
- Follow your clinic's instructions to make sure the surgery goes smoothly.

### 3.3 Allow the clinic to do the procedure. 

Surgery is completed relatively quickly in the clinic and painlessly because the animal must be anesthetized. The clinic may ask you to return your dog in the morning and pick it up in the afternoon.

### 3.4 Help your dog recover from surgery. 

The clinic can prescribe pain relievers if needed. It is normal for your dog to vomit after surgery as well as stop eating for 1-2 days. Make sure your dog is rested and not moving or running too much for 1-3 days, as this can cause complications. [11]
- A male dog's scrotum can swell within a few days, and the swelling should go away after the wound is cut.
- If the dog keeps licking the wound, have him wear a lick-proof ring, which is a funnel-shaped ring that prevents the dog from licking the wound.
- If the incision is draining the pus and your dog seems painful, bring it to the clinic right away.
- You will need to bring your dog back to the clinic to remove the threads. However, some clinics will use self-digestion.
