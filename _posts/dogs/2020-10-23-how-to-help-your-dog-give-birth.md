title: "How to help your dog give birth?"
summary: Almost all dogs have to shed sometimes. Heavy-shedding dogs, such as sheaves, often shed their hair year-round, but even low-shedding dogs like the poodle experience this from time to time. The amount of hair loss a dog sheds significantly depends on the weather and season, but the dog's overall health is one of the most important factors affecting the amount of hair loss. A dog that sheds more than usual is likely to have undetected health problems. While dogs cannot completely prevent hair loss, you can alleviate them by taking care of your dog's health and grooming the coat.

> When the dog is about to go into labor, their mother instinct takes over - you hardly have to interfere. Even so, if your dog is pregnant, you need to know what will happen during the birthing process and how to provide support when needed. Certain purebred breeds may experience more problems during childbirth. For example, if you have a bulldog or a bulldog, preparation is very important. For all breeds of dogs, you should talk to your veterinarian and get a pregnant mother dog for a checkup.

## 1. Prepare

![Help-Your-Dog-Whelp-or-Deliver-Puppies-Step-1]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-help-your-dog-give-birth/v4-728px-Help-Your-Dog-Whelp-or-Deliver-Puppies-Step-1-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.1 Get your dog checked. 

If you expect your dog to become pregnant, you should bring it to the vet for examination before attempting to breed. Then, bring your dog to the doctor again around 30 days of pregnancy. If your dog is unexpectedly pregnant, take it to your vet as soon as you find out.
- If you are planning on breeding a dog, we recommend that you wait until the bitch is 24 months old or older. Then, the new dog is mature enough for the associated diseases to become apparent.
- Certain types of dogs are susceptible to genetic diseases such as dental problems, patellar luxation, hip dysplasia, spinal defects, allergies, cardiovascular problems, and/or other medical conditions. other. You must consider these important health conditions before you start breeding your dog.

### 1.2 Be cautious in giving medications or vaccines to pregnant dogs. 

Unless directed by your veterinarian, don't give your dog any medications that are not safe for pregnancy. You should also not self-vaccinate your dog.
- Your dog will need to be vaccinated before becoming pregnant in order to pass antibodies to the puppy. If not, don't vaccinate your dog during pregnancy, as some may not be good for embryo development.
- If you take flea control, make sure you use a product that is safe for your pregnant dog.
- Make sure your dog has regular worming. The untreated mother dog can pass the nematodes, hookworms, or parasites that live in the heart/blood vessels to the puppies.

### 1.3 Understand the normal cycle of pregnancy. 

The average gestation time in dogs is between 58 and 68 days. Try to pinpoint when to conceive so you can see when your dog will give birth.
- On day 45 of pregnancy, the veterinarian can use X-rays to track the number of puppies in the litter.
- In addition, you may notice the mother dog's nesting behavior and tendencies to hide or recluse; this is normal and worth looking forward to.

### 1.4 Talk to your veterinarian about your diet. 

Most mothers, if they do not gain weight during pregnancy, need to be fed their puppy food for the third to half of pregnancy.
- Dog food usually contains more calories than adult dog food, which is the number of nutrients the mother needs to convert to the embryo.
- Do not add extra calcium to the mother unless directed by the veterinarian. Milk fever (eclampsia) is a common symptom in young dogs several weeks after birth. This condition is more likely to occur if the mother dog absorbs excess calcium during pregnancy.

### 1.5 Ask the vet to take an x-ray to see the puppy. 

Your doctor will count the number of puppies in your litter size on x-rays from day 45 onwards.
- If your dog is a German Shepherd or a Labrador, a litter of approximately 10 is normal.
- If your dog is a small breed like a Chihuahua or a Shih Tzu, 3 or 4 puppies in a litter are considered multiple.
- If the veterinarian has only seen one to two puppies, there may be a problem in delivery. A small number of puppies means the dog will grow bigger and may become too large to pass through the birth canal normally. In these cases, a cesarean section is the most suitable option.
- Although a cesarean can be more expensive, it is still cheaper than an emergency cesarean delivery. So, be prepared.

### 1.6 Set up a nest for your dog. 

About a week before the dog is born, you need to prepare an air in a quiet, private area where the dog can enter and give birth.
- Help the mother feel comfortable by keeping the warm box away from other pets.
- A baby shower box or tub lined with a clean old towel or blanket will do the trick.

![Help-Your-Dog-Whelp-or-Deliver-Puppies-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-help-your-dog-give-birth/v4-728px-Help-Your-Dog-Whelp-or-Deliver-Puppies-Step-7.jpg.webp)

### 1.7 Make arrangements for the puppies to live in. 

As soon as you know your dog is pregnant, whether planned or unexpected, you must prepare a new family for the puppies that are about to be born.
- If you can't find a new home for all your puppies, be prepared to keep them until you find a home for them. Thousands of dogs have to squeeze each other to take refuge in the "orphanage" of cats and dogs because the owners carelessly breed their dogs without support for the puppies to have a new family. You do not contribute to that situation.
- Prepare to live with the puppies for at least 8 weeks before allowing them to move into a new home. In certain regions, such as California in the US, it is illegal to leave a puppy less than 8 weeks old.
- To ensure a good future for the puppies you should go through a selection process and ask questions about the interests of the adopters. It's a good idea to get a decent amount of money for each dog. This is to make sure that the care of the family is taken seriously and that they are committed to adopting the puppies.

### 1.8 Buy puppy formula ready. 

Newborn puppies should be fed every 2 to 4 hours. Have a formula ready in case the puppies cannot suckle.
- You can buy a puppy formula at most pet stores.

![Help-Your-Dog-Whelp-or-Deliver-Puppies-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-help-your-dog-give-birth/v4-728px-Help-Your-Dog-Whelp-or-Deliver-Puppies-Step-9.jpg.webp)

### 1.9 Isolate the mother for three weeks before the expected birth date. 

In order to protect the mother and her puppies from illness or disease (eg Herpes, a dysplasia in dogs), you should separate the mother from other dogs during the last three weeks of pregnancy.
- Another thing to consider is to keep the mother away from other dogs for the next three weeks after birth.

## 2. Support when the dog "goes into labor"

![Help-Your-Dog-Whelp-or-Deliver-Puppies-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-help-your-dog-give-birth/v4-728px-Help-Your-Dog-Whelp-or-Deliver-Puppies-Step-10.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Watch closely for signs that your dog is about to give birth. 

There are a number of signs that can help you predict an imminent birth; therefore, you need to take precautions so that you can be ready when the dog is about to go into labor.
- Your dog's nipples will become larger as it gets closer to delivery due to the coming of milk. These signs may appear a few days before the birth or as soon as the birth begins, so watch them closely.
- Your dog's vulva will begin to hatch a few days before giving birth.
- Your dog's body temperature will also drop by a few degrees around 24 hours before birth. Take a mother dog's temperature each morning during the last week or two of her pregnancy to see her normal body temperature. To take your dog's body temperature, lubricate the rectal thermometer and insert the thermometer tip about 1 cm deep in the rectum. Let stand for three minutes to get an accurate reading. A normal mother dog temperature should be between 38.3 and 39.2 degrees Celsius. If the dog's body temperature drops a few degrees, this is a sign that the dog will be born in the next 24 hours or less.
- When your dog is about to give birth, your dog may gasp, whine, walk around as if he's upset, or hide. Your dog may also stop eating and drinking, but be sure to keep it hydrated.

![Help-Your-Dog-Whelp-or-Deliver-Puppies-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-help-your-dog-give-birth/v4-728px-Help-Your-Dog-Whelp-or-Deliver-Puppies-Step-11.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Wait for uterine contractions.

It's easy to see when the dog is in labor: the contractions will appear like ripples on the dog's belly.
- If you notice a contraction and the feeling that your dog is about to give birth, lead the dog into the nest area and monitor it remotely. Many dogs will give birth at night for complete tranquility. You don't need to intervene, but you should start paying attention to the timing of contractions and the puppy's birth.

![Help-Your-Dog-Whelp-or-Deliver-Puppies-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-help-your-dog-give-birth/v4-728px-Help-Your-Dog-Whelp-or-Deliver-Puppies-Step-12.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Supervise the birth process. Again, you should observe from a moderate distance and do not immerse your hands unless necessary.

You should see your dog's cramps more and more frequently and/or more pronounced around the time of delivery. Maybe the dog will get up, which is fine, don't force him to lie down.

![Help-Your-Dog-Whelp-or-Deliver-Puppies-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-help-your-dog-give-birth/v4-728px-Help-Your-Dog-Whelp-or-Deliver-Puppies-Step-13.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 Pay attention to each birth. When your dog starts to give birth, you should carefully observe each birth and watch out for signs if there is a problem.

Puppies may pull their head or tail out first; both postures are normal.
- The mother dog will whine and whine when the puppies are born, which is to be expected. But if the mother dog starts to show extreme or unusual pain, call your veterinarian right away.
- Usually, a puppy will appear thirty minutes or more apart after about 10 to 30 minutes of intense spasms, (although even the mother dog gives birth to puppies can be up to 4 hours apart). Call your doctor if no puppies appear within 30-60 minutes of strong contractions. Also, contact your doctor if it has been more than four hours since the mother dog gave birth to a puppy and you know the puppies are still out.

![Help-Your-Dog-Whelp-or-Deliver-Puppies-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-help-your-dog-give-birth/v4-728px-Help-Your-Dog-Whelp-or-Deliver-Puppies-Step-14.jpg.webp)

### 2.5 Supervise each puppy that is born. No intervention is necessary, but keep an eye on each puppy that is born and watch for signs of a problem.

When the mother dog gives birth, the puppy will lie in an amniotic sac; The mother will tear the water wrap, chew the umbilical cord, and lick the puppy. It is best to let the mother do her favor without getting involved, as this is part of the bonding experience between the dog and the puppy.
- However, if the mother does not tear the amniotic sac for two to four minutes, gently open it with clean hands. Clean the fluid from the puppy's nose and mouth, then gently rub the dog gently to stimulate respiration.
- Make sure the puppy's body temperature is warm, but again, do not interfere unless you notice a problem. Newborn mortality (such as stillbirth or puppies that only live a few hours or days) is a common phenomenon with most mammals giving birth, so be prepared for this possibility. If you see a newborn puppy that is not breathing, try to clean its mouth and stimulate it by rubbing the person to see if the puppy is breathing.

## 3. Postpartum care for your dog

![Help-Your-Dog-Whelp-or-Deliver-Puppies-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-help-your-dog-give-birth/v4-728px-Help-Your-Dog-Whelp-or-Deliver-Puppies-Step-15.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Continue to feed your dog high-calorie food. 

Provide a high-calorie diet for the mother dog (eg puppy food) to keep her healthy enough to care for her baby.
- It is important to provide adequate nutrients for both the mother and the puppies. This way, the puppies can recover and help the puppies grow.

![Help-Your-Dog-Whelp-or-Deliver-Puppies-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-help-your-dog-give-birth/v4-728px-Help-Your-Dog-Whelp-or-Deliver-Puppies-Step-16.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Supervise the mother for several weeks after giving birth. 

Female dogs are susceptible to a number of diseases and postpartum complications, such as:
- Watch for signs of metritis (an inflamed uterus), including fever, body discharge with an unpleasant odor, fatigue, loss of appetite, decreased lactation, and decreased interest in the puppy.
- Watch for signs of eclampsia, including being impatient, restless, decreased interest in the puppy, and difficulty walking. If left untreated, eclampsia can develop into muscle spasms, loss of ability to stand, fever, and complications.
- Watch for signs of mastitis (inflamed mammary glands), including red, stiff, and tender mammary glands. The mother may try to prevent her from breastfeeding, however, you should urge the puppy to breastfeed as this can help push the infection out without harming the puppy.

![Help-Your-Dog-Whelp-or-Deliver-Puppies-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-help-your-dog-give-birth/v4-728px-Help-Your-Dog-Whelp-or-Deliver-Puppies-Step-17.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Expect everything well and be prepared for a bad situation as well. Check that the mother dog is taking good care of the puppies and that there are no signs of the disease in the postnatal period.

If problems arise, call your veterinarian and bring your dog to see if necessary.

> What you need
- Latex medical gloves (available in pharmacies)
- Clean towels and old blankets
- A hard box
- Have your veterinarian's phone number ready (including an emergency number) in the speed dial feature
- Powdered milk for puppies (in case the puppies cannot suckle)

> Warning
- Unspayed female dogs are at risk of developing an infection of the uterus, called pyoderma after the heat cycle has occurred. This is a serious, potentially life-threatening condition that requires prompt treatment. Monitor the mother after each oestrus cycle to make sure she doesn't show signs of illness such as vomiting, loss of appetite, or unusual thirst.

> Advice
- Make sure your dog has enough space to breed.
- Take note of the veterinarian's number as well as the pet hospital emergency number and keep it with you during the days the dog is about to give birth.
- If you have small children in your home, keep them away from the mother and the puppies. The mother dog may show an interest in protecting her baby and become aggressive, which is normal for some dogs. Keep babies away from newborn puppies as they can injure weak puppies. When the mother is about to give birth, try to take it to a safe room away from children and other pets to make it feel safe. Help if the mother starts to show anxiety or stress. When necessary, comfort or soothe the mother with gentle words.
- Most dogs breed on their own without serious problems; therefore it is best to observe the process remotely and intervene only when necessary.
