> Dogs are the ideal pet and great companionship, but even the best dog will bark constantly at times. Dog barking causes many causes, and this troubling behavior is not only a nuisance but in many places is considered illegal. The first step to teaching your dog to stop barking is to find out what makes it so noisy. Once you know why your dog is barking, you will know what to do to stop it. Knowing how to tell your dog to stop barking will help keep the community space quiet and you won't get in trouble with the law.

## 1. Barking Control Required

![Get-Dogs-to-Stop-Barking-Step-1]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-stop-barking/v4-728px-Get-Dogs-to-Stop-Barking-Step-1-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 1.1 Stop responding to the request. 

Also known as "attention barking," the demanding barking pattern is a common problem for dog owners. The first step in treating the required barking pattern is to stop giving the dog what it wants every time it barks. Of course, this takes time to train, especially when your dog has been accustomed to "being rewarded" when barking for many years.
- Try to differentiate between a toilet barking (having the right to speak) and a barking whenever the dog requires small chores such as going on the sofa or getting more attention. 
- Never give in, no matter how hard the dog barked. Any concessions to the dog's demanding barking will ruin the progress you may have made.

### 1.2 Ignore the barking. 

A demanding or attention-grabbing barking style may be the only way your dog knows how to show it. Even if you stop responding to its requirements, it may still take a while to break the habit. During this time, it is best to ignore the demanding behavior of the dog instead of punishing it. 
- In the dog's mind, even the sound of you screaming for it to be quiet is of concern. If you get impatient and yell at you, the dog may bark for a long time because it gets used to a response (even if it responds negatively). 
- When your dog barks, don't yell or coax or respond to what he wants. Don't even look at it. The best strategy is to distract yourself, such as reading a book until your dog has calmed down or has "run out of breath". 

![Get-Dogs-to-Stop-Barking-Step-3]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-stop-barking/v4-728px-Get-Dogs-to-Stop-Barking-Step-3-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 1.3 Reward your dog for good behavior. 

Once the dog finally stops barking, it's important to reward it for its silence. 
- Gradually your dog will learn that it is better to be quiet and obedient than fussy and barking.
- Have your dog's favorite treat in hand to reward it whenever it stops barking. The reward should be given as soon as the dog does what you want to be most effective at teaching the dog. 
- Praise the dog when it stops barking. Say "Good!" and treat the dog to his favorite treat.
- Once your dog has learned that silence is rewarded and barking is ignored, you need to gradually extend the amount of time your dog has to be quiet before being treated. For example, when your dog has passed the first phase of stopping and being rewarded, extend the amount of time the dog is silent each day for a few seconds and then up to a minute or two before giving the treat. 
- For best results, change how long your dog has to stay silent before rewarding him. This way the dog will no longer get used to the reward after a certain time, and it will keep quiet to wait. For example, after a few weeks of training, you should change the time to keep the dog silent, sometimes up to 20 seconds, sometimes up to a minute, sometimes up to 30 or 40 seconds.

### 1.4 Replace with another behavior. One of the best ways to train animals to get rid of bad habits is to teach them a different behavior. This way instead of being frustrated and annoyed by being unresponsive, your dog will eventually learn that if he wants to be satisfied, he will have to do something more welcome.

Teaching your dog alternative behavior can take a long time, but it's the best way to encourage good behavior. Instead of responding to every loud barking your dog wants to play with, you can teach your dog to bring his favorite toy on the floor for you.
- You can also prevent your dog's bad behavior by reducing the likelihood of such a situation. For example, if your dog barks for help every time his ball rolls under the sofa, try putting something under the chair to stop the dog toy from rolling in.

### 1.5 Continue training. 

Don't stop teaching your dog to get rid of attention-grabbing barking. Continue the training until the dog stops barking demanding/getting attention on everything. Eventually, your dog will learn to wait patiently when it wants to play, eat, or be petted.

## 2. Reassure the Anxiety of Distance

![Get-Dogs-to-Stop-Barking-Step-6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-stop-barking/v4-728px-Get-Dogs-to-Stop-Barking-Step-6-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Recognize distress anxiety. 

Dog distress can take many forms, but the most common symptoms are damage to furniture and constant barking. These behaviors are especially common when a dog's owner goes to work or away from home, and if the dog is not petty some owners may not be aware that their dog has distress anxiety. Signs of distress anxiety syndrome to watch out for include:
- following you from room to room, even if you are only absent for a few seconds 
- trembling, panting, or hissing when you are about to leave home 
- go to the toilet in the house when you're away 
- chew on household items when you're not around 
- scratching or "digging" on floors, walls, or doors when left alone
- Maybe your neighbor complains about a dog barking or howling when left alone 

![Get-Dogs-to-Stop-Barking-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-stop-barking/v4-728px-Get-Dogs-to-Stop-Barking-Step-7-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Try the reverse conditioning method. 

Reversal conditioning is a common treatment, characterized by training a dog to associate scariness with a reward. In the case of fear of distance, instead of being afraid of someone or something, the dog is afraid of being alone. To combat aloof anxiety, you will need to teach your dog to associate being alone with something he enjoys (a treat, for example). 
- Every time you leave the house, try giving your dog a toy with food inside. Something empty to tuck into your dog's favorite, cheese spray, or low-fat peanut butter can keep your dog on for at least 20-30 minutes, so enough time for it forgets the fear of leaving its owner. 
- When you get home, take back or hide the mysterious toy so your dog gets used to it only when you leave the house.
- Note that the reverse conditioning method is usually only effective for mild cases. While your dog is sure to enjoy the mysterious toy, you may need more intense therapy if your dog has moderate or severe distress. 

![Get-Dogs-to-Stop-Barking-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-stop-barking/v4-728px-Get-Dogs-to-Stop-Barking-Step-8-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Train your dog to be less sensitive to loneliness. 

If your dog has moderate or severe distress anxiety, it may be difficult to cure in the short term. A good way to get your dog used to loneliness is to gradually reduce its sensitivity to being alone while asserting that you're prepared to leave does not mean leaving it alone. This is a slow process, takes weeks of practice and persistence, but will pay off in the long run.
- Treat your dog's anxiety before the owner leaves by showing him signs of leaving the house, for example wearing a coat or shaking the keys. Try doing these at different times of the day without actually leaving the house.
- Teach your dog to become more comfortable with being alone by practicing "out of sight". This includes teaching the dog to sit or lie down, and then leave the room or get out of sight.
- Once your dog has gotten used to not seeing you, try closing the door to keep it from coming near you and gradually prolonging the amount of time you spend outside the room or behind closed doors. 
- Out of sight training should begin with interior doors such as the bathroom or bedroom door. Don't try to do it at the front door, as it may alert your dog.
- After a few weeks, you should move out of sight at the exit. However, you should only use the side door (if any) instead of the door that you normally use to get out of the house to go to work. For example, instead of using the front door or the garage door, try the back door. 
- While training your dog not to see you, incorporate reverse conditioning methods like giving your dog a mysterious toy to distract you. Try this option if you're behind a closed door or exit through the back door for at least 10-20 seconds at a time. 

![Get-Dogs-to-Stop-Barking-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-stop-barking/v4-728px-Get-Dogs-to-Stop-Barking-Step-9-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 Please be patient. 

It takes a lot of training and practice to familiarize your dog with your long absences. Most dog anxiety occurs within the first 40 minutes of your walk, and it will take a lot of training before you can comfortably achieve a 40-minute absence. 
- Only increase your absence by a few seconds per training session. Just a little longer away can also distract your dog and provoke its panic responses. 
- Once a dog is comfortable with being alone for up to 90 minutes, it will withstand four or eight hours of solitude. However in the early stages before reaching that level of comfort, it's best to "try" your dog for four hours instead of immediately leaving it at home throughout the workday (if possible).
- If you consistently train and practice multiple times every weekend and at least twice a day of the week (before work and in the evening), you can complete the training in less than a month. Every dog ​​is different, however, and your dog may need longer training periods or more training per day.
- Be patient, and remember that your dog makes such fuss just because he loves you and is afraid you will abandon him.

![Get-Dogs-to-Stop-Barking-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-stop-barking/v4-728px-Get-Dogs-to-Stop-Barking-Step-10-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.5 Consider other options. 

If your dog is completely unwell despite training, or your landlord or neighbor is impatient with its annoying behavior, you may want to consider alternative options.
- Find out if you can bring your dog to work (depending on where you work). This may not be ideal, but many offices are also dog-friendly, especially when you present your situation to your boss. 
- Arrange to have a friend or family member look after your dog while you are away. Most dogs are only anxious about being alone when left alone. In other words, it would be fine if there was someone by my side.
- Think about training your dog in a crate. The success of this training varies from case to case. Some dogs are scared of being in the box, but others consider the box to be their safe space and are assured that the owner will come home one day to open it. 
- Seek the help of a dog trainer if none of the above has been successful. Your dog trainer will know how to best help your dog. You can search online for a dog trainer near you or ask a veterinarian for referrals.

## 2. Prevent Barking Alert

### 3.1 Recognize alarm barking.

An alarm barking is a barking when the dog recognizes an intruder. While barking at an intruder is helpful and can even save lives, but when barking at someone the dog considers an intruder like a postman, deliveryman, or even a passing neighbor. Passing can cause frustrating and troublesome sessions.
- It is not necessary to see an "intruder" for the dog to bark. Many dogs can bark at the sound of a car door or a voice on the road.
- Alarm barking behavior can be accompanied by a forward (several centimeters) motion with each barking sound. 

![Get-Dogs-to-Stop-Barking-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-stop-barking/v4-728px-Get-Dogs-to-Stop-Barking-Step-12-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Teach your dog to keep quiet. 

The best way to control alarm barking is to teach your dog to be silent on command. Like all training goals, this is a time-consuming process and requires patience and persistence. But if you invest the time and effort, even a dog with the highest "sense of ownership" will learn the right manners. 
- When your dog starts barking an alarm, hold out his favorite treat three or four hours after the barking. This move will attract its attention and almost distract it from the "intruder". 
- Wait until the dog stops barking. Just be patient and continue to show its reward.
- When the dog stops barking, say "shut up" in a calm but stern tone and treat it with a treat.
- Repeat this process until your dog knows to associate the word "silent" with the fact that it stops barking. Once your dog has done at least 10 of these successfully, you can order him to be quiet without presenting the treats. If your dog still obeys your commands, reward him with a treat. If your dog is not obedient, you will need to train it again and again by showing it to him or her a favorite treat.
- Eventually, your dog will learn to be silent at command without being treated. However, even once you have reached this training goal, you should verbally praise your dog when he stops barking. 

![Get-Dogs-to-Stop-Barking-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-stop-barking/v4-728px-Get-Dogs-to-Stop-Barking-Step-13-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Use the silent command. 

Once your dog has learned the command to silence during training sessions, you should use it in real life. You can do this by having a friend slam the car door in front of your house, shake the mailbox to click or move to the front door. 
- Get your dog's favorite treat ready every time your friend comes to the door. Even if you have passed the dog treats during the training phase, you may still need to use your dog's favorites when applying it to real-world situations with a real “intruder”.
- When you ask someone to come to the door pretend to be the messenger, it is essential that the person does not leave until your dog stops barking. If your friend leaves while the dog is barking, he will think his barking will keep the stranger away.
