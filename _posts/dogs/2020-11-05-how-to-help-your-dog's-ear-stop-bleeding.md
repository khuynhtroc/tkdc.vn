### 1.1 Keep calm. 

There are many blood vessels concentrated in the ear. So when there is an ear injury, the blood usually doesn't stop. However, do not worry. In healthy dogs, blood will not bleed too much. In addition, the dog's mood depends on the human emotions. If you are angry or frightened, it will be agitated. Excitement raises the blood pressure leading to more bleeding.

Lift the dog's ears over his head, and use a gauze pad to apply the wound. Carefully roll the sock tube over the dog's head. Pay attention to avoid the nose and eyes area.
