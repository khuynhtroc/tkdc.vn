### 2.1 Determine if your dog's bite is playful or aggressive. 

All dogs, especially puppies, are prone to biting, and it can help you understand the difference between them when they bite. However, whatever the reason, this behavior is difficult to accept and should be prevented.
- When playing, the dog bites will not hurt and their body relaxes. [5]
- When aggressive, the dog will flex and appear tense. [6]
- Aggressive biting is usually quicker, stronger, and more painful. [7]

### 2.2 Teach your dog how to use his teeth and mouth gently. 

Dogs are pack creatures and they learn from playing with their fellow humans when they are young. It is perfectly okay for a dog to bite you, but you should still start training them not to bite. [8]
- When your dog bites, call out loudly.
- Stop playing with your dog for a few seconds.
- Praise your dog and keep playing.
- If the dog or puppy doesn't stop biting after you yell, leave and try again. [9]

### 2.3 Use isolation to prevent dog bites. 

If the puppy or adult dog doesn't respond to your call and stops playing for a while, try quarantine. Ignoring the dog is an effective way of letting him know that his behavior is not being accepted. [ten]
- When the dog bites, call out loudly.
- Ignore your dog for 10 to 20 seconds. [11]
- You can also leave the dog alone for 10 to 20 seconds.

### 2.4 Reward your dog's good behavior consistently. 

It is important that you let your dog know which behavior is a good one. Always praise your dog when he stops biting by petting or giving him small treats.
- Only reward behaviors that you want to encourage.
- Have a reward in hand so you can easily reward your dog during training.
- Don't overfeed your dog, give him only small treats.

### 2.5 Continue to teach your dog how to be gentle. 

The dog will start to bite lighter. Keep yelling and stop playing every time your dog bites. [twelfth]

### 2.6 Choose toys and games carefully for your dog. 

It is completely natural if you want to play grappling or tug of war with your dog. However, these tricks can be confusing for your dog, and learning how to instinctively stop biting can become more difficult. [13]

- Avoid wrestling as the dog can become overly agitated or confused.
- Be careful when playing tug of war with your dog. This can make your dog aggressive.

### 3.3 Periodic vaccination for dogs. [17]

### 4.2 Watch for signs of possessiveness in your dog. 

Dogs have an instinct to protect their own. They know what their possessions are and if they feel that their possessions are threatened, they will most likely respond by biting.

### 4.4 Determine if your dog is in pain. 

If your dog bites and does not appear to be playing, it is most likely in pain. Even though he is the most gentle and friendly dog, he can still bite you when he is in pain. If you suspect that your dog is unwell, you should seek medical attention promptly. Look for the following signs:

### 4.6 Identify the dog biting due to hunting behavior. 

The hunting instinct in dogs is, for the most part, very strong. If something does appear on their "hunt", they will bite.
