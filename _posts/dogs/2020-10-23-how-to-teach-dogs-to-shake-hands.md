> Teaching your dog to shake hands can be much better than just a show. Once your dog understands how to sit and when to sit, you will help him increase compliance and become more attached to you. Start training your dog so he can perform this simple trick.

## 1. Initial Training

### 1.1 Choose a treat for your dog. 

You will have to reward the dog when it is done correctly. Buy something your dog likes and bring it with you when teaching him how to shake hands. Small, mouth-to-mouth foods are great for training your dog as you can enjoy it multiple times without fear of being obese. You should also consider the dog's favorite foods: does he like to eat soft or hard food? What taste do dogs like? Learn what your dog likes best and prepare it for training. [first]
- Make your own food to reward your dog. These can be small pieces of cooked meat or fruit or vegetables. [2]
- Don't overfeed your dog. Make each serving as small as possible. [3]
- Do not give your dog the following because they can poison or fall ill : avocado, chocolate, bread dough, fresh grapes or raisins, hops, alcohol, moldy food, macca nuts , xylitol, onions and garlic. [4]

### 1.2 Have the dog sit down. 

A dog can only shake hands while it is sitting. If your dog does not understand the command to sit down, you need to teach him to sit. [5] [6]
- Don't reward your dog with that treat yet, as you are teaching your dog to shake hands, not sit down.

### 1.3 Let the dog see the food. 

You shouldn't be enjoying dog food yet. Now hold the food with your left hand. Hold the food in front of the dog's nose and let the dog see it. Once you have the dog's attention, hold your hands to hide the food. [7]
- Don't let the dog take your food.
- Clip the food between your thumb and palm.

### 1.4 Say the command "Raise your hand. 

" This will be the command you will use when you want it to shake hands (you can also say something like "Shake hands"). Say this command when you hold your favorite food out in front of it.

### 1.5 Say "Good job" when the dog starts to restless. 

When the dog realizes that you have a favorite treat in hand, it will try to take it. When it does what you want - like raising your foot to get the food in your hand - say "Good job!" with an excited tone and offering the food to it.
- When the dog does what you want, give it a treat immediately.
- Ignore any other dog movements, like smelling or licking your hand. [8]
- Please be patient.
- Exercise over and over until the dog always puts his paws up every time you say "Raise your hand."

### 1.6 Reward the dog for shaking hands. 

Once the dog has raised its paw at the command, take the next step. You will start rewarding your dog only if he does something similar to a handshake. For example, if your dog brings his paws higher first, say "Good job" and enjoy the food, but don't reward it before he does. Continue exercising until your dog always puts his paws up when you give a command.

### 1.7 Grab your dog's forelegs with your hand. 

Use this extra step if the dog is not asking the food in your hand. By grabbing the dog's foreleg, praising it during and after doing so, you will make the dog understand: poking your hand can help him eat. [9]
- Hold the dog's front paw for a few seconds before giving the treat.
- Be gentle and slow.

## 2. Instructions for Dogs to Listen to Commands

### 2.1 Introduce the command. 

After the dog has learned to pick up food from your fist, you can begin instructing it to listen to commands. Wait until the dog pokes your hand, then give it a command while giving it a treat. [ten]
- You can use any word, but usually it will be single words like "Catch!" or "Hand!".
- Use a clear command and loud enough for your dog to hear.
- Give the command just as the dog starts poking at you.
- Once you have chosen the command word, do not change it, because by doing so, the dog will be confused. [11]
- All orders must be brief. One-word command will work best. [twelfth]

### 2.2 Start to shout first. 

After you have given the right signal the moment the dog swings, it's time to be able to give the signal before that time. When reaching your dog with food hand, call out a command. [13]
- This way, the dog will recognize that the signal is the signal to pounce on food.
- Ideally, if the dog leans out the hand as soon as you give a command.
- Only after shaking hands do you feed your dog and praise him.
- If the dog does nothing when giving the command, try again until it succeeds. If it still doesn't work after 15 minutes, stop and practice later. You should not confuse your dog.

### 2.3 Only reward your dog when he has fulfilled the command. 

If you reward your dog for other actions, he will be confused. Never reward your dog for not fulfilling an order, otherwise he will assume you bribe him with food. [14]
- Avoid other inappropriate rewards by winning your dog's attention before training.
- Do not be in a hurry to reward the dog food if the dog cannot "shake hands" as ordered. If you do, the dog will understand: I am rewarded with food when I sit down and ignore the owner.
- Know that dogs are pretty smart. Any treats for the dog will be related to the dog what it is doing at that time.
- Your dog will want food. Once the dog has understood that a certain action can bring him good food, he will always be ready to repeat it. This is true of both good and bad deeds. Be mindful of this when rewarding dog food.

## 3. Advanced Technique

### 3.1 Start giving up food. 

Ultimately, you will need to stop rewarding your dog when you shake hands. Do this slowly each time the dog "shakes hands" with you. Replace with compliments or other rewards like walking or playing. [15] [16]
- Continue practicing until you are confident that the dog will "shake hands" without being rewarded.
- You can try holding out your bare hands when you begin this step.

### 3.2 Increased challenge. 

Once you feel your dog has mastered the "handshake" game, give it a few more challenges. Wait for a distracting situation to appear, such as going to a crowded area or someone is approaching the gong and giving the dog a command. [17]
- The more you practice in a variety of situations, the better your dog will perform in the handshake.

### 3.3 Shake hands with the other hand. 

Follow the same training order as with the other hand. The only difference is that you will be holding the food in your other hand and rewarding the dog only when it is caught in your other hand. [18]
- You can use a different command. If you used "Catch!", You can use "Hand!" to the other side. Or more simply, say "Left" or "Right" to distinguish the two hands. [19]

> Advice
- It is important to be patient. Always be consistent in rewarding a dog's action, as well as when to reward it.
- Don't get angry if the dog is unable to follow your orders. Please be patient.
- Feed your dog the food with your other hand, not with the hand you just used to shake your hand.
- Always be optimistic and happy with your dog. Praise it a lot.
- Serious but don't be too harsh. Patience and consistency is all you need. Reward your dog every time he is obedient. You need the dog to obey your commands, not play tricks for the food.
