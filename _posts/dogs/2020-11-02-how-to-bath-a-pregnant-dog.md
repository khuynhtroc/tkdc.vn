## 1. Prepare to shower

### 1.1 Comfort for pets. 

When dealing with a pregnant dog, it is important to keep him calm. The womb can make the mother difficult to control if she starts to squirm. Pet your pet a lot and talk gently. Do whatever it takes to relax the mother.
- If you find that the mother is trying to escape, ask someone for help. Pets will be petted more!
- If the mother is afraid of bathing, don't force her. Instead, brush only to remove as much dirt as possible. This will be easier for both of them.
- Let the mud dry before you brush the mother.

### 1.2 Proceed as usual. 

Even if you are worried about bathing your pregnant dog, don't let him or her notice your anxiety. Think of this as normal bathing, and should not change hygiene.
- For example, if you often carry dogs in the tub, you should still clean them in a familiar place. Do not use a sprinkler for fear of lifting them.

### 1.3 Preparing instruments. 

Have treats ready to reward your dog for calm or persuading her to go into the bath. You also need to prepare shampoo and towel to dry before letting them shake in the house.[first] You can place a towel on the side of the tub so the water doesn't splash on the floor.
- Use a soothing pet oat-based shampoo so that it won't irritate the mother dog's skin.
- You will probably get wet too, so wear casual clothes so you don't mind getting wet. [2]

### 1.4 Place the anti-slip plate on the bottom of the tub. 

The bottom of the tub is quite slippery when pouring water and soap. An anti-slip sheet helps to keep your posture in place while the mother is bathing. You can buy this tool in a store or online.

## 2. Bathe your pregnant dog

### 2.1 Put the dog in the tub. 

You need to be very gentle. If your dog is large, ask someone else to help you carry the pet. Do not carry it on the stomach, as it will cause discomfort or pain for the mother. Instead, you should thread your arm under your hind legs, and the other arm under your neck. Lift the mother up from her chest and buttocks.
- If the pet is small, you can use the kitchen sink.

### 2.2 Open water. 

Turn the tap hot and cold at the same time to make the water warm. If you have a shower, spray it first to moisten the mother's coat. If you don't have a shower, you can use a cup to pour water over them.
- Cuddle and talk gently to calm the mother.

### 2.3 Rinse the tub first if the mother is afraid of it. 

The sound of a strong flushing tap can make them scared! Some will feel less anxious when the bath is filled with water. After the water is fully rinsed, you can gently carry them into the tub. Use a cup to pour water over her instead of a shower.

### 2.4 Apply shampoo on her body. 

Rub from front to back. Start at the nape of the neck, then the neck and then the whole body. Apply the shampoo on the legs and tail last. Touch the abdomen gently, and use enough force to clean it. Do not scrub or squeeze the mother dog's stomach.
- Do not use shampoo on her face, as it can get in her eyes, nose, or mouth. Instead, wipe their face with a damp cloth.[3]
- Do not let soap get in her dog's ears.

### 2.5 Rinse off the shampoo from the bristles. 

If the mother is not afraid of the sound of running water, turn on the water and use the shower to rinse the soap. If your pet is afraid of the sound of water, use a water mug to pour water on them.
- Rinse off the soap until no more bubbles are left on the bristles.

### 2.6 Take the dog out of the tub. 

Use the same method as when placing them in the tub: lift by chest and buttocks. Be careful not to put pressure on the mother's stomach. Place all four feet on the floor and then release the pet so it doesn't fall out of your hand.

### 2.7 Dry the mother dog. 

If your pet is not afraid of loud sounds, you can use a dryer to quickly dry their body. However, most dogs like to dry with a towel. The mother dog has more hair than her body, so you will need to use more towels.
- You do not need to completely dry the dog's body. Just dry well so the water doesn't drip onto the floor.
- Let the coat dry naturally.

> Advice
- Exercise in a calm and effective manner. You do not need to hurry!
- Use a mild oatmeal shampoo that's suitable for dog skin and hair.
- Reward your dog with food after bathing.
- Consider hiring a hygienist to come home if you don't think you can afford to safely bathe your dog.

> Warning
- Do not bathe your dog at the date of birth or a few days before going into labor. The mother dog can give birth in the shower, so wait a few days before bathing her.
