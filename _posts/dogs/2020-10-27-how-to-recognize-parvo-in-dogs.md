> Infectious disease Canine parvovirus (also known as Parvo disease) is an inflammatory bowel disease - the stomach is highly contagious and causes a great death rate. This virus usually breaks out in puppies. Longtime dog owners and breeders often feel confused to suspect that one of their dogs has Parvo's disease. They know how quickly and dangerously things can go wrong. If your dog has Parvo, see your veterinarian right away to increase the odds of survival. However, do not be confused as symptoms of Parvo are very similar to those of dogs such as Corona virus infection, bacterial hemorrhagic enteritis, coccidiosis and destructive hookworm.

## 1. Recognizing the Symptoms of Parvo Disease

### 1.1 Consider your dog's age. 

Parvo disease usually breaks out in puppies 6 to 20 weeks old and 85% of infections arise from puppies under 1 year old. Puppies are most susceptible because they have many rapidly dividing cells in the stomach and intestines. These cells are the primary targets of the Parvo virus. If your dog is older, Parvo will be less likely to develop, though not impossible.
- If the mother dog is not vaccinated against Parvo, it is very likely that the virus will break out earlier in the first few weeks.

### 1.2 Pay attention to the breed of the dog. 

Parvo disease usually develops in certain breeds of dog breeds such as the American pitbull, the Doberman Pinscher, and the German shepherd. If your dog belongs to one of these breeds, you should pay special attention to whether it has Parvo or not.

### 1.3 Watch your dog's behavior. 

In general, the first manifestation of a dog infected with Parvo is lethargy. Your puppy will probably be less active, lying in a corner of the house and determined not to move. Then appears weak and loses appetite.

### 1.5 Pay attention to your dog's vomit. 

Parvo disease destroys the stomach containing many rapidly dividing cells. This is the target of the virus. The stomach lining will become swollen and ulcerated causing the dog to vomit.

### 1.6 Observe the dog's feces. 

If your dog has diarrhea, has loose, muddy, bloody or irregularly shaped stools, chances are he has Parvo disease. It can also dehydrate your dog.

### 1.7 Check if your dog has symptoms of anemia. 

Parvo disease makes dogs suffer from gastrointestinal bleeding causing anemia. To check if your dog is anemic, press your hand against the dog's gums. The gums color of a healthy dog ​​will quickly return to its normal color in about 2 seconds. If it takes longer than that, your dog may have diarrhea. The benefits of dogs with this disease often look visibly pale.

### 2.1 Get your dog to the vet right away. 

The earlier you bring it in, the better your dog has a better chance of survival. Unfortunately, many owners do not recognize the symptoms early or wait too long to see their dog. That is when the disease is in its final stage and the dog will die from dehydration.

### 2.2 Requires ELISA-Antigen test. 

To diagnose Parvo's disease, it is possible that the veterinarian will use the biochemical test for antigen detection (ELISA). This method will check your dog's feces for Parvo or not. This can be done in a veterinarian's office.
- The ELISA method can give quick results but is not always accurate. Note that a bad result does not necessarily reflect your dog's condition properly.

### 2.3 Do some more testing. 

Using the ELISA method is sometimes not enough to diagnose Parvo's disease. Your veterinarian may perform a live test of red blood cell agglutination, blood volume and / or stool samples. The results of these tests together with the ELISA can help correctly identify Parvo in dogs.

### 2.4 Follow your veterinarian's instructions for proper treatment. 

There is currently no cure for the Parvo virus, but your veterinarian can advise you on supportive therapy and practical measures to improve your dog's survival. Some of the following methods can be used:
- Treatment in hospital
- Give your dog antiemetics
- Intravenous fluids

- Vaccination is the only way to keep your puppy from getting Parvo. The first shot should be done when the dog is 5 to 6 weeks old. Then, every 2 to 3 weeks need to inject once and must inject at least 3 shots.
- Parvo is a persistent virus that does not degrade easily. This virus is resistant to many types of biocides and can last for up to many months or even more. It is important to ensure cleanliness and disinfection of the dog. Look for products that can safely remove parvo or bleach using formulas of one part bleach, 30 parts water.
- Parvo is a viral disease and cannot be treated with antibiotics.
