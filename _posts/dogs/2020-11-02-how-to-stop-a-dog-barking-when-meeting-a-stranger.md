### 1.1 Recognize the cause of the sovereignty bark. 

Dogs often bark to show ownership when meeting strangers. This barking indicates that the dog is frightened and sees a stranger as a potential threat. They worry about protecting their territory, so they will use barking sounds when they see strangers in familiar places like their home and yard.[first]
- In fact, the dog may bark the threat so excessively that it will not listen to your request to stop barking or any insults you gave it. Even if you use severe punishment to stop the dog from barking, it tries to control its territory by biting someone.
- Some dogs also bark when they meet a stranger to alert their owners of the potential threat. Pictures and sounds are often the cause of the dog's alarm barking. Dogs bark sometimes alert to strangers even when they are not in their home or yard. Your dog may bark when it sees a stranger in a park, on the street, or in an unfamiliar place.

### 1.2 Do not scream or yell when the dog is barking. 

Most dog experts agree that yelling, yelling, or even hitting a dog for a barking can actually cause them to bark more. If your dog is barking out of fear or anxiety, the punishment will only add to the stress in the dog. Instead, train your dog to respond properly to strangers, and only bark when needed.[2]
- We have dogs for barking so don't get angry if your dog is barking at random sounds like door slams and street noise. However, dogs barking at strangers need training to make sure they don't become too aggressive toward others.

### 1.3 Avoid relying on the muzzle to keep the dog from barking.

Some owners may want to use a muzzle to prevent the dog from barking. Usually, containment collars should be the last resort, not the first option. The barking and muzzle collars are not as effective as proper dog training and can lead to other behavior problems.[3]

## 2. Limit your dog's contact with strangers

### 2.1 Block your dog's view of strangers at the door. 

It is important to deal with a dog's barking by creating an environment that limits their view of others. Keep curtains or blinds in place all day when your dog is home. You can also make baby gates so that the dog can't get into rooms with large windows where they can see out.[4]
- For the longer term option, place a movable plastic film or spray a coating on the window to make it difficult for the dog to see outside. Doing so will limit the dog's ability to see humans, so it will have less incentive to defend its territory and bark.

### 2.2 Surrounding the yard with a high fence. 

If your dog likes to run in the yard, put a high fence around the yard so that it cannot see strangers on the street or in nearby areas. This will reduce the need for the dog to bark and allow him to play without being distracted by strangers.[5]
- The fence will also limit the dog's view of the road while it is inside, so it will be unable to see strangers and bark.

### 2.3 Distract your dog from barking by shaking the keys. 

The sound will startle your dog and stop barking. Then call your dog away from a door or window and tell him to "sit". Give the dog a treat and then tell him to "sit still". If the dog continues to sit and is quiet, give it a treat for a few minutes until the stranger is gone.[6]
- If the dog starts barking again after sitting, shake the keys again and repeat the steps.

- Release the dog's snout and step back. Then call the dog away from the door or window by calling its name and saying "come here".
- Ask your dog to sit and reward him with a treat. If it continues to sit and is quiet, give it a bonus after a few minutes until the stranger leaves.

### 3.2 Use the "silent" method without holding the dog's snout. 

If you feel uncomfortable holding the dog's muzzle or if you feel like doing so might frighten him, try the "silent" method without holding it.[8]
- Allow your dog to bark three to four times. Then, come over and say "shut up". Encourage its silence by giving it pea-sized treats like cooked chicken, sausage or cheese. Repeat this process several times over a few days until your dog seems to understand what "silence" is. Your dog should stop barking when you say "shut up".
- After a few days of training, extend the time between giving the "silent" signal and rewarding your dog. Say “shut up” and wait 2 seconds before rewarding. Gradually increase the wait time to 5 seconds, then 10 seconds, then 20 seconds. Increase the wait time to 30 seconds before rewarding your dog.

### 3.3 Use treats to keep your dog from barking during a walk. 

If your dog intends to bark at a stranger when he is out of the house, you can distract him from barking with special soft treats such as cooked chicken, cheese or sausage. Learn to read your dog's body language and cues that tell him when he will bark. This will differ from dog to dog, but may include: erect hair, raised ears, or a change in the way you walk. When you notice these changes, distract the dog before it starts barking. [9]
- Hold the food in front of the dog's nose so it can see it. Instructing your dog to chew on food when passing a stranger may cause it to bark. You can also order your dog to sit and eat when other people pass.
- Always reward and reward your dog again if it does not bark when someone passes by.

### 3.4 Train your dog to sit in the cage if he barks at a stranger while in the car. 

Some dogs tend to bark while in a car and may become anxious or afraid of strangers on the road or in other vehicles. Keeping the dog in the cage during the trip will limit the dog's view and make it less likely to bark.[ten]
- If your dog is uncomfortable sitting in the cage, you can train him to wear a seat belt while in the car. The seatbelt is meant to calm your dog. You can also wear a dog seat belt while walking or around the house if it intends to bark. But avoid relying entirely on seat belts to stop your dog from barking. A more permanent solution to the problem is to train your dog not to bark when meeting strangers.
