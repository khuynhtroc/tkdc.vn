## 1. Consider another option

### 1.1 Don't worry about the hot weather. 

You may think that the thick coat makes the dog feel hot. In fact, the coat is responsible for insulating, cooling, and protecting the skin from the sun. Therefore, we should not shave pets.
- In addition to its cooling function, the coat protects the skin from harmful ultraviolet rays. If not, the dog is susceptible to sunburn and is at risk of skin cancer. 
- Some (not all) experts point out that some hybrid dog breeds have thick fur because their habitat is cold and cannot adapt to high ambient temperatures. Consult with your doctor about the thickness of your dog's coat and see if you should trim it.
- Even if your dog needs some trimming, do not shave too much, leave about 2.5 cm to protect the skin from the sun.

### 1.2 Consider moisture. 

The best reason to shave your dog is rain, not hot weather. Dogs are often susceptible to maggots, and the larvae multiply in their fur if the coat is damp for a long time. This problem can be quite serious if the dog has thick, shaggy fur and runs out in the rain a lot.
- Talk to your doctor about whether maggots are having a serious impact on your pets. Even if your dog encounters the potential risks mentioned above, you can still prevent it by maintaining good hygiene and taking good care of any open wounds on his body.

### 1.3 Do not shave dogs with the dual coat. 

This coat has a hidden undercoat underneath. This class is difficult to discern because it is covered by a thicker upper coat, but some common breeds have a double coat, including the German Shepherd, the Squirrel, the Dog, the Husky, the Malamute, and the Samoyed. As they age, their feathers will not regrow if they are shaven, becoming patchy and ragged.

### 1.4 Consider professional service. 

The cost of taking care of a pet usually ranges from 300 to 500 thousand VND. This cost includes the necessary hair trimming, nail care, and grooming.
- For some, the price is too high, but in general, your pet is healthy without shaving. Therefore, if you have to choose between the two options, choose to not shave them.
- While shaving, you can injure your dog. Then, the cost of paying the specialist will be cheaper, as the amount of money for treating them in the event of an injury can be even higher than for cleaning services.

## 2. Shave your dog's fur

### 2.1 Prepare supplies. 

You need to buy a trimmer, comb with trimmer, brush, and lubricant. Dog clippers are available at pet or pet stores.
- If your dog gets startled by loud noises, try a variety of trimmers to check how loud they are. Then choose a trimmer that doesn't make much noise.
- Buy an E-size comb. This type has a design that leaves about 2.5 cm of feathers and is generally recommended.

### 2.2 Don't let the trimmer get too hot. 

Otherwise, the dog will burn. Take a break to let the trimmer cool down. Apply the lubricant that comes with the trimmer to avoid heat buildup.

### 2.3 Bathe your dog. 

If the hair is messed up, it will be difficult to use the trimmer, causing the dog pain. Before you start shaving, you should clean and brush them for complete disassembly.

### 2.4 Keep the dog with a collar. 

You won't want your pet to move too much while shaving. If the dog won't cooperate, get a helper to keep the dog in place.

### 2.5 Shave in the direction of hair growth.

If shaving in the opposite direction, the scrape will be uneven and become jagged. You need to work slowly and gently. 
- If you are unsure of which direction to shave, you can take your credit card and brush it along the coat. If the coat is ruffled and leans back, you are brushing in the opposite direction of the hair growth. Then you need to shave in the opposite direction.

### 2.6 Start with sensitive areas. 

Over time the dog will decrease his patience. You need to prioritize handling important areas, then move to other areas.
- Shaving procedures include head, armpits, under tail, nape, sides of body, abdomen.
- Only shave your face when the puppy is completely still and keep the trimmer a few centimeters away from your eyes while shaving.

### 2.7 Shave your armpits. 

While your dog is standing, lift his front legs up to the correct position. Shave under this area and repeat on the other side.

### 2.8 Shave the groin area. 

Raise your pet's hind legs up like poop and shave under this area. This step is to keep your pet clean when dealing with sadness, especially long-haired breeds. Then repeat with the other leg.

### 2.9 Shave your buttocks. 

Raise the tail and shave the area so that they can go to the toilet. However, you need to take extreme care when handling this sensitive area.

### 2.10 Shave remaining area. 

Start with the nape and down the neck, back, and sides. Shave your abdomen carefully and be careful to shave in a direction away from your hands.
