The dog's skin will be pink, moist, hot, and painful. You can even see sticky fluid oozing from the wound. These are open wounds that become infected and need the intervention of a veterinarian to help alleviate the discomfort.

### 2.1 Check for fleas . 

The most common cause of itching in dogs is fleas. They are most active in warm and humid environments (35 ° C). You may see fleas on the dog, or see the dog chirping or scratching the skin.

### 2.4 Check for lice. 

Dog lice are different from live lice, so don't worry about getting it. Head lice survive on scrap skin or suck dog's blood, depending on the species. Adult lice can be seen on dogs - they are yellow or skin-colored and about the size of sesame seeds. You can sometimes confuse lice with dandruff, but they won't come off when you shake the dog's fur.[7]

### 2.5 Check for dog hair mite. 

The demodectic mange is a small species of tick that lives naturally on dogs. This parasite generally does not cause skin problems, other than weakening the dog's immune system. The sheath is usually found in puppies, as the puppies' immune systems are still developing. You can easily see them on the skin around the eyes and mouth. A veterinarian can make a diagnosis by taking a scraped sample from the dog's skin. [8]

### 2.7 Understand diseases that do not cause itching. 

Your dog may have an illness that looks like a parasitic infection or other illness that confuses you in determining the cause of the itch. Hair loss (alopecia) and Cushing's syndrome are two possible situations.
- Hair loss can be caused by hypothyroidism and is usually not itchy. Dogs with hypothyroidism are more likely to experience skin problems than usual. [twelfth]

![Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-diagnose-and-treat-dog-skin-diseases/v4-728px-Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-13.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Use a prescription dog bath oil. 

Dog bath oils prescribed by your veterinarian can help relieve itching and treat bacterial and yeast infections. These products can be taken with oral medications.

If your dog's skin is scratched or infected, do not use any bath oils or lotions without first talking to your veterinarian. You can make the situation worse by using the wrong products.
- Do not bathe your dog too much. Most healthy dogs need a bath once a month, while others need less. The oil on the dog's skin is lost in the bath. If your veterinarian prescribes a special dog bath oil, he or she will recommend the number of baths depending on the condition of the dog.

![Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-diagnose-and-treat-dog-skin-diseases/v4-728px-Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-14.jpg.webp)

### 3.6 Ask your doctor about antihistamines. 

Antihistamines may also be used to control an allergic reaction. [23] There are many antihistamines on the market, and your veterinarian can recommend over-the-counter as well as prescription medications.
- No single product will work for every dog, so “antihistamine testing” should be done to find out which drug works best for your dog.

### 3.9 Ask about a veterinarian who specializes in dermatology. 

If your dog has a lot of itchiness and scratching to the point that it is hurting the skin, ask your veterinarian to refer a veterinarian who specializes in dermatology. This doctor specializes in the treatment of skin diseases in animals.

### 3.10 Avoid over-the-counter itching remedies.

You should consult with your veterinarian before trying any over-the-counter therapies to treat your dog.

## 4. Change your dog's diet

![Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-diagnose-and-treat-dog-skin-diseases/v4-728px-Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-20.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Consider your dog's current diet. 

Improving your dog's nutrition will help improve your dog's overall health, whether or not he has a food allergy.
- If you are feeding your dog processed food, read the nutrition on the packaging. Make sure the main ingredient is protein, not carbohydrates. Essential fatty acids are good for dog skin and hair and should be included in food ingredients. [27] , [28]

![Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-21]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-diagnose-and-treat-dog-skin-diseases/v4-728px-Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-21.jpg.webp)

### 4.2 Give your dog a fatty acid supplement. 

Fatty acid supplements such as fish oil, coconut oil, or flaxseed oil are helpful for skin allergies in dogs. These foods are best eaten whole (fresh or canned fish, freshly ground flaxseed), but can also be taken as capsules or as liquid. [29] , [30]
- Follow the directions on the product label or take as prescribed by your veterinarian.

![Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-22]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-diagnose-and-treat-dog-skin-diseases/v4-728px-Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-22.jpg.webp)

### 4.3 Ask your veterinarian about food exclusion testing. 

If there is suspicion of a food allergy, your veterinarian may recommend a completely new food elimination test, including ingredients the dog has never eaten.
- For example, if your pet has been eating dog food including rice and lamb plus a beef and wheat reward, then the new diet will not include any of the above.
- This test method is usually done for 2-3 months.
- You need to follow a strict dog diet (including treats) to get the best test results.
- It can take several rounds of food elimination tests to determine which foods are likely to be susceptible to foods.
- You can buy dog ​​food at the pet store, but a special diet provided by your veterinarian may be necessary in treating dog food allergies. [thirty first]
- Once you've found a diet, you can start trying small amounts of each ingredient to see if your dog itches again after adding the ingredients.

> Advice
- Some breeds of dogs like the Golden Retrievers, Labradors and Cocker Spaniels seem more susceptible to allergies. However, any dog, even hybrid dogs, can develop allergies at any time. [32]
- Control fleas year round.
- Do not shave the dog's hair close to the skin. Shearing in damaged areas can help, but you should avoid shedding all of the dog's fur, unless advised by your veterinarian. In some cases, shaving, even healthy dogs, results in a different color or inability to regrow the hair. [33]
- There is no single drug or treatment that is appropriate or effective for every pet. You may have to use a variety of therapies to fix the problem.
- Understand that it is more common to treat and control symptoms than to treat the cause. Observing and finding an irritant in dogs takes time.

> Warning
- Always do it gradually and step by step when making changes to your dog's diet. Change only one ingredient at a time and start with small amounts.
- Remember that allergies can only be controlled, cannot be cured, and allergic reactions can gradually develop in the dog's life. This can sometimes be confusing and uncomfortable for both dogs and humans, but if you understand the nature of the disease it is important for your pet's health and well-being.
- Steroids and antibiotics may be needed in severe skin allergies from the very beginning of treatment. Any medication has side effects, so talk to your veterinarian at the beginning of treatment and in case of prolonged treatment.
