title: "How to Diagnose and Treat Dog Skin Diseases?"
summary: As in humans, allergies in dogs are manageable but not treatable. A dog's body is sensitive to certain stimuli, and this sensitization response causes itching. Dogs may be allergic to food, flea bites, grass or pollen in the environment, and allergies to direct contact with mixtures such as laundry soap or to hay. The first step is to diagnose an itchy, scratching and gnawing phenomenon like an allergic skin condition. The challenge for dog owners and veterinarians is finding the cause and the effective treatment.

## 1. Watch for itching in your dog

### 1.1 Watch out for itchy parts of the dog's body. 

Are there more itchy areas of dog skin than others? Does your dog lick the paws, under the tail or along the belly?
- The most commonly irritated skin areas when a dog is allergic are the back, tail, abdomen, legs, and nails.

![Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-2]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-diagnose-and-treat-dog-skin-diseases/v4-728px-Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-2-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.2 Look for hot spots on the dog's skin. 

A fairly common condition is a dog itching is intensely itchy and has to gnaw its skin to the point of forming "hot spots". Such skin lesions can grow very quickly and spread. The dog's skin will be pink, moist, hot, and painful. You can even see sticky fluid oozing from the wound. These are open wounds that become infected and need the intervention of a veterinarian to help alleviate the discomfort.
- Chronic itching can lead to thicker and rough dog skin.
- Hot spots on dog skin are often a symptom of an allergy to fleas, food, grass, mold or other environmental substances. There are also more complex underlying medical conditions such as hypothyroidism or Cushing's syndrome (hyperadrenocorticism). Secondary bacterial and yeast infections are uncommon and require special treatment. [first]

### 1.3 Consider the timing. 

Your dog may get more itchy at particular times of the year. Your dog may get itchy after playing on the lawn or after eating certain foods. By keeping the rules in mind, you can narrow the focus on treating your dog's itch. [2]

![Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-4]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-diagnose-and-treat-dog-skin-diseases/v4-728px-Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-4-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.4 Check the dog's overall health. 

If your dog's body odor is too strong, he seems overly thirsty, or doesn't seem as agile as usual, you should take it to the doctor. The veterinarian will have to test the dog's blood and scraping samples for more information to help determine the correct treatment.

![Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-5]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-diagnose-and-treat-dog-skin-diseases/v4-728px-Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-5-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.5 Take a note every time you find your dog itchy. 

Whenever you find your dog itchy, make a note of the situation, including where the dog was, what he ate and which parts of the dog itch. This is extremely useful for veterinarians, as they will rely on that information to narrow the scope of finding the cause of the itch and damage in the dog's skin.

## 2. Check for parasites

### 2.1 Check for fleas . 

The most common cause of itching in dogs is fleas. They are most active in warm and humid environments (35 Â° C). You may see fleas on the dog, or see the dog chirping or scratching the skin. Fleas are very fast and can jump very high so you will have to quickly find them. Fleas usually reside in the armpit and groin areas, they are usually dark (almost black) in color and flattened. [3]
- Check your dog's ears for any scratches, redness, blood, or dirt. Check the dog's belly, groin, or under the tail for red bumps.
- One way to check for fleas is to have your dog stand on a white surface, such as a tissue or a piece of paper, and then brush the dog's fur. The flea droppings will drop when you brush the dog's fur and will become more visible on white paper.

### 2.2 Check the scabies. 

The Sarcoptes scabiei is a parasite that usually lives on hairless skin areas such as the ear, elbows or abdomen. These areas are often red and scaly. [4] Scabies can cause serious skin damage and harm your dog because they cause severe itching. [5]
- Scabies is a contagious disease and can be easily transmitted to humans and other dogs.
- A veterinarian can diagnose scabies by taking a sample scraped off the dog's skin.

### 2.3 Check for dog ticks. 

The disease is caused by a parasite called Cheyletiella that lives by eating the outermost layer of the skin. In addition to excessive scratching, your dog may experience scaling, hair loss, dandruff, and back damage. [6]
- It is sometimes referred to as "walking dandruff" because dog ticks cause the skin to become scaly as they move, like flakes that move.
- You can see dog mites, they are yellow.

### 2.4 Check for lice. 

Dog lice are different from live lice, so don't worry about getting it. Head lice survive on scrap skin or suck dog's blood, depending on the species. Adult lice can be seen on dogs - they are yellow or skin-colored and about the size of sesame seeds. You can sometimes confuse lice with dandruff, but they won't come off when you shake the dog's fur.[7]
- Other signs of lice presence are hair loss (especially around the neck, ears, shoulder blades, groin and anus); rough, dry, or dull hair; have minor wounds or infections; tapeworms and other parasites can be transmitted by lice; can even cause anemia in severe cases or in young dogs.

![Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-diagnose-and-treat-dog-skin-diseases/v4-728px-Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-8-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.5 Check for dog hair mite. 

The demodectic mange is a small species of tick that lives naturally on dogs. This parasite generally does not cause skin problems, other than weakening the dog's immune system. The sheath is usually found in puppies, as the puppies' immune systems are still developing. You can easily see them on the skin around the eyes and mouth. A veterinarian can make a diagnosis by taking a scraped sample from the dog's skin. [8]
- Bum mite is not very contagious, and humans cannot be infected. This disease is usually passed from the mother to the nursing puppies. [9]
- This disease can be inherited. It is not uncommon for puppies to get fluff if the parents have had it at some time. [ten]

![Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-diagnose-and-treat-dog-skin-diseases/v4-728px-Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-6-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.6 Check for ringworm. 

Actually, ringworm is a fungus. They cause small, round, scaly, itchy patches (about 1 cm diameter) and hair loss in one or more areas of the dog's skin. Ringworm usually begins to appear on the face and claws of the dog. It is a contagious disease and very easily transmitted to humans (zoonotic disease) and other pets. A veterinarian can diagnose ringworm and recommend a treatment regimen, which includes a fungicide.
- Some pets can be treated with topical medicine, while others require an antifungal medication.
- Treatment of ringworm, including home disinfection, can take several months to get under control. [11]

![Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-diagnose-and-treat-dog-skin-diseases/v4-728px-Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-9-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.7 Understand diseases that do not cause itching. 

Your dog may have an illness that looks like a parasitic infection or other illness that confuses you in determining the cause of the itch. Hair loss (alopecia) and Cushing's syndrome are two possible situations.
- Hair loss can be caused by hypothyroidism and is usually not itchy. Dogs with hypothyroidism are more likely to experience skin problems than usual. [twelfth]
- Dogs with Cushing's syndrome will drink plenty of water and have an appetite all day. You will also notice that the coat is thinner and has less puppy hair. The dog's belly area can be nearly bare and the skin will appear thinner.

## 3. Treat your dog's itch

![Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-diagnose-and-treat-dog-skin-diseases/v4-728px-Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-10-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Discuss treatment with your veterinarian. 

There are many possible causes of this serious problem, so there are also many treatments a vet can prescribe. [13] Unfortunately, antihistamines are not very effective in dogs, and most cases require short-term treatment with steroids or one of the anti-itch medications such as Apoquel or Atopica. There are always new products on the market. [14] , [15]
- Use prescription medication as directed by your veterinarian. Medication is used to control the itch and initiate the healing process.

![Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-diagnose-and-treat-dog-skin-diseases/v4-728px-Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-11.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Take measures to control fleas. 

Flea-related atopic dermatitis is one of the most common causes of itching in dogs. [16] Treating flea bites is often the first step in dealing with itchiness in your pet, even if you can't see it. Dogs can develop an allergic reaction to flea saliva and intense itching, even if caused by just one flea. [17]
- You need to control fleas for dogs and other pets in the house, in addition to the contact environment should be handled and continue to do this every month.

![Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-diagnose-and-treat-dog-skin-diseases/v4-728px-Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-12.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Treat dogs parasites. 

Each type of parasite requires different treatments. Severe cases of body molluscum contagiosum can take months to treat, while scabies can be treated in weeks. [18] , [19] The veterinarian will prescribe drugs for the treatment of parasites.
- Scabies can be easily transmitted to other pets and to humans. You will need to take steps to disinfect all of your surroundings and to deal with scabies on dogs and other pets that may be infected. [20]

![Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-diagnose-and-treat-dog-skin-diseases/v4-728px-Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-13.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Use a prescription dog bath oil. 

Dog bath oils prescribed by your veterinarian can help relieve itching and treat bacterial and yeast infections. These products can be taken with oral medications.
- Dog flea bath oils, such as coal tar bath oils or medicated bath oils, are at risk of further irritating open wounds. You should consult with your veterinarian before trying any of the over-the-counter treatments for your dog.
- Bathing your dog is a great remedy for itchy skin, but don't use human shower oils. A gentle dog oat bath oil can help relieve itching temporarily. If your dog's skin is scratched or infected, do not use any bath oils or lotions without first talking to your veterinarian. You can make the situation worse by using the wrong products.
- Do not bathe your dog too much. Most healthy dogs need a bath once a month, while others need less. The oil on the dog's skin is lost in the bath. If your veterinarian prescribes a special dog bath oil, he or she will recommend the number of baths depending on the condition of the dog.

![Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-diagnose-and-treat-dog-skin-diseases/v4-728px-Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-14.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Ask your doctor about the steroid drug Prednisone. 

The first-line treatment for moderate to severe itching is the steroid drug Prednisone, which is intended to provide temporary relief of itching. Reducing itching and making your dog more comfortable will facilitate skin healing.
- Steroids have side effects and should be used with caution. Long-term use can lead to liver or adrenal problems. [21] , [22]

![Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-diagnose-and-treat-dog-skin-diseases/v4-728px-Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-15.jpg.webp)

### 3.6 Ask your doctor about antihistamines. 

Antihistamines may also be used to control an allergic reaction. [23] There are many antihistamines on the market, and your veterinarian can recommend over-the-counter as well as prescription medications.
- No single product will work for every dog, so âantihistamine testingâ should be done to find out which drug works best for your dog.
- Note that antihistamines may not help dogs with severe itching, but they are often used after steroids to treat the initial problem, thereby helping to manage the symptoms. allergy.

![Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-diagnose-and-treat-dog-skin-diseases/v4-728px-Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-16.jpg.webp)

### 3.7 Take antibiotics. 

The veterinarian may use an antibiotic in combination with an anti-itch medication. This is because secondary infections often occur when the skin is damaged by scratching.

![Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-diagnose-and-treat-dog-skin-diseases/v4-728px-Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-17.jpg.webp)

### 3.8 Talk to your veterinarian about allergy testing options. 

You can have your dog have a blood or skin test to narrow the range of allergens such as pollen, plants, grass, insects, or mold. [24] The best way to identify a food allergy is a test for elimination. [25] , [26]
- Your veterinarian may recommend immunotherapy if allergies are the cause of the itch.

![Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-diagnose-and-treat-dog-skin-diseases/v4-728px-Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-18.jpg.webp)

### 3.9 Ask about a veterinarian who specializes in dermatology. 

If your dog has a lot of itchiness and scratching to the point that it is hurting the skin, ask your veterinarian to refer a veterinarian who specializes in dermatology. This doctor specializes in the treatment of skin diseases in animals.

![Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-diagnose-and-treat-dog-skin-diseases/v4-728px-Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-19.jpg.webp)

### 3.10 Avoid over-the-counter itching remedies. 

Over-the-counter therapies such as medicated bath oils, coal tar bath oils, tea tree oil baths, ostrich oil, and aloe vera are all the last treatments dog owners will often try in the hope that a remedy is available. function. You should consult with your veterinarian before trying any over-the-counter therapies to treat your dog.
- Other home remedies like turpentine, Vaseline wax, mouthwash, or white vinegar should also be avoided. However, harmless topical treatments such as green tea and coconut oil can be effective for mild dry skin and no signs of infection.
- Your efforts can make the situation worse for both you and your pet.

## 4. Change your dog's diet

![Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-diagnose-and-treat-dog-skin-diseases/v4-728px-Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-20.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Consider your dog's current diet. 

Improving your dog's nutrition will help improve your dog's overall health, whether or not he has a food allergy.
- If you are feeding your dog processed food, read the nutrition on the packaging. Make sure the main ingredient is protein, not carbohydrates. Essential fatty acids are good for dog skin and hair and should be included in food ingredients. [27] , [28]

![Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-21]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-diagnose-and-treat-dog-skin-diseases/v4-728px-Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-21.jpg.webp)

### 4.2 Give your dog a fatty acid supplement. 

Fatty acid supplements such as fish oil, coconut oil, or flaxseed oil are helpful for skin allergies in dogs. These foods are best eaten whole (fresh or canned fish, freshly ground flaxseed), but can also be taken as capsules or as liquid. [29] , [30]
- Follow the directions on the product label or take as prescribed by your veterinarian.

![Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-22]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-diagnose-and-treat-dog-skin-diseases/v4-728px-Diagnose-and-Treat-Your-Dog's-Itchy-Skin-Problems-Step-22.jpg.webp)

### 4.3 Ask your veterinarian about food exclusion testing. 

If there is suspicion of a food allergy, your veterinarian may recommend a completely new food elimination test, including ingredients the dog has never eaten.
- For example, if your pet has been eating dog food including rice and lamb plus a beef and wheat reward, then the new diet will not include any of the above.
- This test method is usually done for 2-3 months.
- You need to follow a strict dog diet (including treats) to get the best test results.
- It can take several rounds of food elimination tests to determine which foods are likely to be susceptible to foods.
- You can buy dog ââfood at the pet store, but a special diet provided by your veterinarian may be necessary in treating dog food allergies. [thirty first]
- Once you've found a diet, you can start trying small amounts of each ingredient to see if your dog itches again after adding the ingredients.

> Advice
- Some breeds of dogs like the Golden Retrievers, Labradors and Cocker Spaniels seem more susceptible to allergies. However, any dog, even hybrid dogs, can develop allergies at any time. [32]
- Control fleas year round.
- Do not shave the dog's hair close to the skin. Shearing in damaged areas can help, but you should avoid shedding all of the dog's fur, unless advised by your veterinarian. In some cases, shaving, even healthy dogs, results in a different color or inability to regrow the hair. [33]
- There is no single drug or treatment that is appropriate or effective for every pet. You may have to use a variety of therapies to fix the problem.
- Understand that it is more common to treat and control symptoms than to treat the cause. Observing and finding an irritant in dogs takes time.

> Warning
- Always do it gradually and step by step when making changes to your dog's diet. Change only one ingredient at a time and start with small amounts.
- Remember that allergies can only be controlled, cannot be cured, and allergic reactions can gradually develop in the dog's life. This can sometimes be confusing and uncomfortable for both dogs and humans, but if you understand the nature of the disease it is important for your pet's health and well-being.
- Steroids and antibiotics may be needed in severe skin allergies from the very beginning of treatment. Any medication has side effects, so talk to your veterinarian at the beginning of treatment and in case of prolonged treatment.
