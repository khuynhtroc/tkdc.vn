### 1.1 Know how to recognize ticks and their preferred environments. 

Ticks like tall grass and low shrubs. Some dog ticks are very small - almost the size of a flea - others much larger. Dog ticks are usually black or brown in color and have an oval body. Like spiders and scorpions, they belong to a group of arthropods called the arachnoid layer and have 8 legs.

### 1.2 Prepare the necessary tools before looking for ticks. 

You will need a pair of thin-tipped tweezers and a bottle of alcohol. You will also need some antiseptic such as chlorhexidine (Nolvasan) or a solution of povidine iodine (Betadine) to wash the wound after catching the tick on the dog.
- If you live in an area with a lot of ticks, you may want to buy a device designed to remove ticks. The tool looks like a spoon with a V-shaped groove inside and is very effective at catching ticks on people and pets.
- Unlike commonly thought, you cannot kill ticks by flushing them down the toilet. The only good way you can get rid of ticks is to put them in alcohol or spray them with a spray to kill ticks and fleas. [first]

### 1.4 Find ticks on the dog's body. 

You should check for ticks on the dog's fur every time it comes back from places where you know they have ticks (on a picnic, in the garden with tall grass, etc.) You can feel the little spots and dark round particles visible. Start from the back of the dog and slowly find the chest and belly. Remember to look in and around the following areas: [2]
- Foot
- Between the toenails and the pads of the feet
- Areas below the legs (armpits), abdomen, chest, and tail
- Above, inside, and below the ears
- Face and top of head
- Chin
- The front of the neck

### 1.5 Use a brush when the dog has thick or curly hair. 

If you find it difficult to find in the fur, you may need to use a tight-fitting comb to brush and find ticks. If that doesn't help, you can use a cool-down hair dryer to remove the hair. However, you should also note that some dogs are afraid of hair dryers.
- These tools should only support the hand when looking for ticks, as the best method is still to touch them with your hands.

### 2.2 Separate each area of ​​the dog's coat when looking for ticks. 

You will need to separate the dog's fur when looking for a tick to avoid losing track. If you miss it out, just check the area again. The tick will not move while sucking blood because it is plugged into the dog's skin.

- Some of the most effective sprays contain the ingredient "fipronil." This spray will kill ticks, but not kill them immediately.

Clip the tick at its head and mouth, right where it is attached to the dog's skin. It is important that you clamp the tip of the tick instead of the body. If you clamp it on the body, it will break open and leave its head stuck in the dog's skin. This can cause skin irritation and infection. [3]

![Get-Ticks-off-Dogs-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-get-rid-of-dog-ticks/v4-728px-Get-Ticks-off-Dogs-Step-17.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Make pets and housing an unfavorable environment for dog ticks. 

Prevention is the most effective way to keep your dog from being attacked by ticks. You can use safe and effective tick and flea control products. There are topical medications, oral medications, and collars for dog tick control. You should consult with your veterinarian before using a new medication. Ways to prevent ticks in dogs and indoors include:
- Keep grass and weeds below ankles.
- Secure trash cans, clean piles of soil and rock and dense cover areas. This will help prevent rodents from carrying ticks.
- Walk on the trail while taking your dog for a walk and be sure to keep your dog by your side. Avoid areas with trees and tall grass where ticks are common. If your dog runs off the trail (they do so very often), make sure to check it when you get home.

> Advice
- Always check for fleas on your pet after they have been outdoors for extended periods of time such as camping, hiking, hunting, or playing at a dog park.
- Always kill the ticks after catching them. The living cicadas will cling to the dog again, to you and everyone in the family.
- Use tick and flea control every month. Consult with your veterinarian before using any product to make sure there are no complications from medication.
- You can also take your dog to a veterinarian or a professional grooming service to get rid of the ticks, especially dogs with a serious infection. Your doctor may recommend antibiotics and testing for tick-borne diseases. Severe tick infections can also lead to anemia, since the tick lives on dog's blood.

> Warning
- Do not use a tick control / flea on your dog without consulting your veterinarian. Each product has its advantages and disadvantages, and the doctor will help you apply specific methods for each case.
- Dog mites can carry pathogens. They can infect you and your pets. In most cases, the ticks will have to cling to the dog's skin and suck blood for more than 24 hours to transmit the disease, so it is even more important to check people and dogs as soon as possible contact with the tick is suspected.
