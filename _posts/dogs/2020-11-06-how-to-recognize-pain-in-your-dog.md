> Experts believe that dogs are more tolerant of pain than humans, so it is very difficult to recognize signs of pain. Some dogs show obvious pain, while others are highly tolerant, making it difficult to recognize. [1] However, there are many ways to recognize pain in your dog.

### 1.1 Watch for limping signs. 

One of the most obvious signs of pain is limping. Your dog will limp with pain when placing weight on one leg. [2]
