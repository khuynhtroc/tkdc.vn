> Dogs are pets that are considered family members and you will definitely want your dog to eat delicious and healthy food. However, do not assume that it is okay to feed your dog human food. Dogs have different nutritional needs from humans, so you need to know what to prepare for your dog's balanced diet. Once you understand the nutritional balance, you can start cooking it.

## 1. Create nutritional balance

### 1.1 Understand the difference between a dog's and a stray dog's diet. 

Wolves or stray dogs can survive in nature without a balanced diet. However, their average lifespan is shorter. A wild dog's food is different from a domestic dog's. Dogs are fed pure protein, while wild dogs can eat organ meats such as kidneys, liver, brain and intestinal contents. This creates a more complex diet than just giving your dog meat (protein) and rice (carbohydrates) bought from the store. [first]
- If your dog is fed on a homemade but unbalanced diet, it will take a long time for health problems to emerge. This is because dogs will be deficient in micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) instead of calories.
- For example, a dog can live well for weeks or years, but after a while, it may break a leg due to a long-term calcium deficiency in the diet. [2]

### 1.2 Ask an expert to set the diet. 

You cannot prepare dog food based solely on a recipe that looks delicious. In fact, since there is no single "right for all" diet for your dog, you will need to feed your dog its own vet's diet. [3] For example, a growing puppy needs twice the calories for every 0.5 kg of body weight for an adult dog, while an older dog needs 20% less than an adult dog. [4]
- A basic diet, even established by a veterinarian, is often nutritionally deficient. One study analyzed 200 recipes created by veterinarians. Most of these formulations lack at least one important nutrient.

### 1.3 Learn to properly prepare meals. 

Once you have a specific recipe, you should prepare the food properly to maintain vitamins and minerals. Always remember to follow the directions exactly. If the recipe uses chicken with skin, you should do exactly that. Do not remove the skin as it can imbalance the fat. You should also use a kitchen scale instead of using a cup to carefully weigh ingredients. [5]
- Do not overcook vegetables to preserve nutrients. Instead, steam or blanch to preserve the vitamin. [6]
- Do not create or replace ingredients by yourself. This can cause nutritional imbalances. [7]

### 1.4 Add calcium to your dog's diet. 

Dogs have a very high requirement for calcium and although you can feed your dog bones there are health risks. Bones can rupture, scratching the intestinal lining and causing inflammation and sepsis. Instead, you can add calcium carbonate, calcium citrate, or eggshell ground to a fine powder for your dog. One teaspoon is equivalent to about 2200 mg of calcium carbonate and an adult dog weighing 15 kg needs 1 g a day (half a teaspoon). [8]
- Bones can clump together causing intestinal obstruction and need surgery to remove. Also, it is difficult to know when dogs get enough calcium from the bones they eat.

## 2. Prepare food

### 2.1 Protein supplement. 

An adult dog weighing 15 kg needs a minimum of 25 g of pure protein per day. [9] Protein can include eggs (which contain many of the essential amino acids that your dog needs), followed by animal protein, like chicken, lamb or turkey. High-quality plant-based foods like protein-rich beans, nuts and eggs can be included in your diet. Make sure you have at least 10% of your dog's diet quality protein (meat). [ten]
- Proteins are made up of small blocks called amino acids. There are 10 amino acids that dogs cannot make on their own and must be obtained through the diet.

### 2.2 Add fat. 

An adult dog weighing 15 kg (about the size of the average Staffordshire Bun) needs at least 14 g of fat per day. [11] You can give your dog meat or chicken skin to ensure you get enough fat in your diet. Experts recommend that a minimum of 5% of the dog's diet should contain fat (by weight). [twelfth]
- Fat contains fat-soluble vitamins that are essential for good health. These vitamins also play a role in the creation of new functional cells.

### 2.3 Add carbohydrates. 

Carbohydrates are the source of the majority of calories for dogs. Specifically, half of your dog's food should contain carbohydrates. A 14-kg dog needs about 930 calories a day. [13] You should include wheat, rice, oats, and barley in your diet to make sure your dog gets enough calories.
- Carbohydrates provide energy (while some of the energy comes from protein and fat). Carbohydrates also provide fiber for healthy gut function.

### 2.4 Mineral supplement. 

Dogs need minerals like calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, selenium, iron, and copper. Mineral deficiencies can lead to a host of health problems, including weak bones that break easily, anemia or poor nerve conduction leading to seizures. Different foods contain different levels of minerals, especially fresh fruits and vegetables, which requires careful research to ensure your dog gets enough minerals from each type of diet. [14] Include a variety of high-mineral vegetables in your dog's diet:
- Green leafy vegetables (raw or cooked), such as spinach (spinach), kale, cruciferous spinach, Brussels sprouts, bok choy and rainbow kale
- Pumpkin (cooked)
- Turnip (cooked)
- Radish (cooked)
- French beans (cooked)
- Okra (cooked)

### 2.5 Supplement vitamins. 

Vitamins are an important part of your dog's diet. Lack of vitamins can lead to problems like blindness, a weak immune system, skin damage and sensitivity to infection. Vitamins are found in many foods in varying degrees, so you need to use a variety of vegetables. Green vegetables are often a good source of vitamins and minerals, but some dogs dislike the taste of vegetables and don't want to eat them. Green vegetables can be eaten raw, but may cause your dog to develop gas.
- Avoid overcooking as this will break down vitamins. [15]
- Vegetables that you would not normally eat raw (such as beets, turnips, parsnips or potatoes) should be cooked to prevent the risk of intestinal obstruction and make it easier for your dog to digest.

## 3. Feed the dog

### 3.1 Know how much to feed your dog. 

Find out how many calories your dog really needs to avoid being overweight or losing weight. Note that calorie requirements are not up to a certain standard. For example, a dog that weighs 18 kg does not need twice as many calories as a 9 kg dog. [16]
- You can find a chart of daily calorie requirements for your dog. The chart will give you a general idea of ​​your dog's caloric needs based on body weight. [17]
- Once you have found a general guide to your dog's weight, you should consider if there are lifestyle changes that require adjustment (e.g. when the dog is pregnant, obese, the age of the dog and the dog). have been castrated or sterilized). For example, a 4.5 kg puppy under 4 months of age needs 654 calories, while a dog that weighs 4.5 kg and is desexed needs only 349 calories. [18]

### 3.2 Know what foods are harmful to your dog. 

We all know that chocolate is bad for dogs. However, there are many other foods that are good for humans but harmful to dogs. Therefore, you should check the ingredients carefully before trying to prepare dog food based on this new recipe. Absolutely do not feed the dog: [19]
- Raisins
- Grapes

### 3.3 Prepare a backup menu in case you run out of food. 

It shouldn't be a problem if you feed your dog regularly (4-5 days per week). However, sometimes there are times when the dog runs out of food at home or the dog has a stomach ache and needs a lighter diet. In that case, home-prepared chicken rice is a bowel snack and is a temporary solution when you run out of regular food. Avoid feeding your dog chicken rice for a long time as this dish contains less minerals and vitamins.
- To prepare chicken rice, mix 1 cup chicken breast with 3 cups white rice. Do not add fat or oil to the chicken.
- Give your dog the same amount of food as you normally would normally. [20] Typically, the amount of food will be about 1 1/3 bowl of chicken rice for every 4.5 kg of body weight.

- Use hot water to heat food to room temperature. Then, add the necessary additional food sources such as vitamin C, flaxseed oil, salmon oil, vitamin E, ...
