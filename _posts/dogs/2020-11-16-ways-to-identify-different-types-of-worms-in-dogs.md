title: "Ways to Identify Different Types of Worms in Dogs"
summary: There are different types of worms that can infect dogs. The helminths that are of greatest concern are roundworms, tapeworms, filariasis, hookworms, and whipworms. Each worm has a slightly different life cycle, but the symptoms of a dog helminth infection can be the same in different worms infections. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the type of helminth based solely on the symptoms in the dog, but it is necessary to test. However, knowing the general symptoms, risks, and characteristics of different types of worms can help treat and care for your dog.

> There are different types of worms that can infect dogs. The helminths that are of greatest concern are roundworms, tapeworms, filariasis, hookworms, and whipworms. Each worm has a slightly different life cycle, but the symptoms of a dog helminth infection can be the same in different worms infections. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the type of helminth based solely on the symptoms in the dog, but it is necessary to test. [1] However, knowing the general symptoms, risks, and characteristics of different types of worms can help treat and care for your dog.

## 1. Know if your dog has a worm infection

### 1.1 Be alert for symptoms. 

Many symptoms of helminthiasis are general and nonspecific. Therefore, you cannot diagnose the type of worms your dog has on the symptoms alone. However, signs in dogs that have not been recently wormed can increase the suspicion that your dog has a worm infection, and you should find out what kind of worms your dog has.

### 1.2 Watch for worms in the stool. 

Sometimes, even in dogs without symptoms, you may see signs of helminths in the dog's feces. If you are not completely confident in the identification of worms, you should collect the worm sample in a container with a screw cap and bring it to the vet for identification.
- Worm sampling is much more helpful than describing them to a doctor because most worms look the same on sight.

### 1.3 Identify gastrointestinal signs. 

Although the lifecycle is different, all types of worms travel through the intestinal tract. If the worm count is low, the dog will show no signs. However, when large amounts of helminths enter the intestinal tract, they can irritate the mucosa, cause symptoms like illness, diarrhea (sometimes with mucus and / or blood), loss of appetite, and loss scales. [2]

![Identify-Different-Dog-Worms-Step-5]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-identify-different-types-of-worms-in-dogs/v4-728px-Identify-Different-Dog-Worms-Step-5-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 1.4 Collect stool samples. 

Worms can live in or move through the intestinal tract, so at certain stages in their life cycle signs of a worm infection may be expelled in the dog's feces. In severe helminth infections, you can see real worms in the dog's feces, but this is less common in mild cases. Instead, eggs or helminth larvae may appear in the stool that is difficult for the naked eye to detect. [3]
- Use a popsicle stick or disposable spoon to scoop up the sample and place it in a clean, well-fitting container (your veterinarian can give you a special container for this purpose if you don't have the right item. ).
- Store the stool sample below 30 degrees Celsius and bring it to the vet when possible (the stool sample does not need to be fresh to identify signs of worms).
- If your veterinarian requests a stool sample to be collected, you should take a dog stool sample once a day for 3 consecutive days and put it in the same container. This step may be necessary in the event that a "false negative" result is suspected. The collection of stool samples reduces the risk of receiving unreliable results.
- Your veterinarian can perform an analysis of the feces, which is the process of examining the smear of the stool under a microscope for the eggs or larvae of the helminths. Or the veterinarian can send the stool sample to an outside lab for evaluation.

### 1.5 Ask your veterinarian about blood tests. 

Certain types of helminths (such as roundworms or filariasis) can cause serious illness and should be diagnosed with a blood test. The veterinarian will prick a small amount (1-2 ml) of the dog's blood for testing. [4]
- There are many tests available but in practice, the ELISA test is the most common. This test looks for the presence of filamentous antibodies and causes discoloration if positive.
- Most veterinarians in high-risk areas for filariasis require annual testing as part of a dog's wellness cycle before renewing or prescribing monthly preventive measures.

### 1.6 Avoid contact with feces and worms. 

Some types of helminths, such as roundworms, can be passed from dogs to humans. Young children infected with nematodes can suffer vision damage.
- Worms or feces contaminated with worms should be removed from children's play areas.
- Wear gloves when handling or collecting helminth-contaminated feces.
- Always wash your hands with soap and water after handling animal manure.

### 1.7 Recognize risk factors for specific worms. 

Since helminths can look very similar, the best way to identify a parasite in a dog is to have a good understanding of which environmental or situational factors can cause the most worms. [5]
- Roundworm is usually transmitted to puppies from a mother dog infected with roundworm because the eggs and the larvae cross the placenta to infect the puppies in the womb and the eggs are also secreted in breast milk. Puppies should be wormed as a matter of course.
- Tapeworms are caused by dogs eating animals infected with tapeworms or from dog mites containing tapeworm eggs. Therefore, hunting dogs or dogs with ticks are susceptible to tapeworms.
- Hookworms and whipworms thrive in moist soil, and dogs are most at risk if left out in grass gardens, especially in warm, humid conditions. Cribs released in grass gardens are at high risk for these two types of worms.
- Worms only spread through insects such as mosquitoes and are therefore specific in insect-prone areas. High risk areas are the Southeast, Midwestern United States and along the Atlantic coast.
- Nematodes are becoming more common and spread through fox feces, slugs, and snails. Contact with these subjects is considered a risk factor.

## 2. Distinguish the types of helminths

![Identify-Different-Dog-Worms-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-identify-different-types-of-worms-in-dogs/v4-728px-Identify-Different-Dog-Worms-Step-8-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Get information on any symptoms or risk factors that are applicable to your dog. 

Sometimes, the best way to diagnose a helminth is to document your risk factors for helminth infections. Keep a record of your dog's environmental conditions, climate, and habits. Be sure to keep a record of the severity and when any symptom of illness should be kept in mind to give this information to your veterinarian if a dog is suspected of having helminths.

![Identify-Different-Dog-Worms-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-identify-different-types-of-worms-in-dogs/v4-728px-Identify-Different-Dog-Worms-Step-9-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Observe the characteristics of the worms. 

If you see worms or worms in your dog's feces or vomit, you can identify the type of worms. Although many types of helminths look similar, each will have a number of characteristics that will help you differentiate. [6]
- Roundworms look like cooked pasta. They are 8-10 cm long but can reach 18 cm in length. Roundworm has a round and smooth body.
- Cockroaches are distinguished by the flat stem from the sections that form. The length of tapeworms varies from species to species, but the average is between 50-250 cm. If tapeworms are visible in feces or vomit, they are usually fragments, not the entire tapeworm.
- Hookworms and whipworms are much smaller than roundworms and tapeworms. They are usually 0.5-2 cm long and extremely thin, like a thread or hair. Their small size makes them appear transparent and difficult to see without careful inspection.

![Identify-Different-Dog-Worms-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-identify-different-types-of-worms-in-dogs/v4-728px-Identify-Different-Dog-Worms-Step-10-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Check for respiratory or heart signs. 

Nematodes and worms only infect blood vessels and the heart or lungs. They can cause symptoms like coughing, shortness of breath or shortness of breath, lack of energy, or even fainting and death. [7]
- Nematodes and worms can only interfere with blood clotting, and some dogs may exhibit alarming symptoms such as uncontrolled bleeding after a minor injury.
- See your veterinarian immediately if you experience any of these symptoms. Although the process is expensive, immediate treatment will bring better results.

### 2.4 Check the tapeworm. 

A sure sign of a tapeworm is a tapeworm sticking to the fur near the dog's anus. This happens when an adult tapeworm lays eggs into the intestine, then the eggs crawl through the dog's anus, possibly causing itching around the anus. [8]
- A tapeworm is like a sesame seed or small grains of rice stuck in the hair near your dog's anus.
- If you look carefully, you can sometimes see cream-like, small-seeded tapeworm eggs crawling.

![Identify-Different-Dog-Worms-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-identify-different-types-of-worms-in-dogs/v4-728px-Identify-Different-Dog-Worms-Step-12-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 2.5 Check the dog's condition. 

Worms, especially tapeworms, absorb nutrients from dog food and cause a lack of nutrients available to the host. Therefore, dogs infected with helminths may have less fat covering their bones, but their abdomen is swollen due to the more worms in the intestinal tract. Usually, puppies infected with helminths often have thin ribs, plump belly and dull hair.

![Identify-Different-Dog-Worms-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-identify-different-types-of-worms-in-dogs/v4-728px-Identify-Different-Dog-Worms-Step-13-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 2.6 Take the worms or helminth eggs to your veterinarian. 

The best way to diagnose a specific type of worms is to see a specialist. A specialist can identify a helminth or worm egg with a microscope, and they have experience distinguishing small differences between types of worms. [9]
- For worm eggs, the difference can be difficult to detect, for example oval instead of round, with a pinch on one or both ends.

## 3. Prevent or treat helminths

![Identify-Different-Dog-Worms-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-identify-different-types-of-worms-in-dogs/v4-728px-Identify-Different-Dog-Worms-Step-14-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Identify and treat helminths quickly. 

Worm infections often get worse if left untreated for a long time. Infection with large numbers of adult helminths, known as severe helminth infections, can adversely affect the overall health of dogs. Therefore, identifying the worms before their condition worsens is the best approach.
- Some canine helminth infections can cause gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea.
- Some cases of helminth infections can kill dogs, especially filariasis and nematodes.

![Identify-Different-Dog-Worms-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-identify-different-types-of-worms-in-dogs/v4-728px-Identify-Different-Dog-Worms-Step-15-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Give your dog the worm vaccine only every month. 

Especially if you live in a high-risk area with lots of mosquitoes, you should give your dog a monthly worm. The worm vaccine only requires a prescription from your doctor.
- Most veterinarians ask to see a worm test negative just before prescribing an oral worm.
- Many oral worm vaccines are only meaty and chewable, making them easy to give to your dog.

![Identify-Different-Dog-Worms-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-identify-different-types-of-worms-in-dogs/v4-728px-Identify-Different-Dog-Worms-Step-16-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Keep the dog free of lice. 

Since some types of worms can be transmitted through lice, keeping your dog clean with regular lice killing methods can help prevent infection.
- Some companies manufacture chewable oral tablets that combine the treatment of worms with just the treatment of lice.
- You can also use a monthly topical treatment for lice in dogs. This product is usually applied on the nape of the dog's neck, or the back of the neck.

![Identify-Different-Dog-Worms-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-identify-different-types-of-worms-in-dogs/v4-728px-Identify-Different-Dog-Worms-Step-17-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Limit your dog's exposure to harmful environments. 

Making sure to keep your dog away from a worm-prone environment can help keep your dog away from deworming.
- Keep your dog away from warm, grassy areas with other dogs that have not been dewormed.
- Do not let your dog come into contact with wild animals or prey.
- Avoid warm, humid climates with large numbers of insects such as lice or mosquitoes.
- Do not let your dog eat or roll in the feces of other dogs or wild animals.

![Identify-Different-Dog-Worms-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-identify-different-types-of-worms-in-dogs/v4-728px-Identify-Different-Dog-Worms-Step-18-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Give your dog a worm treatment if needed. 

If your dog is infected with helminths, you may need to give him a worm bleach. The exact worming recipe will depend on the individual dog's risk factors and is best discussed with your veterinarian. [ten]
- Most deworming bleach comes in powder form that you can mix with your dog food or other foods like white yogurt (talk to your veterinarian before giving your dog human food).
- Most deworming bleach requires only one oral dose. But if your veterinarian prescribes Fenbendazole, you will need to give it several days. Fenbendazole is a very mild worm bleach that is commonly used in puppies.
- Be sure to carefully read the instructions on the worm's packaging and consult your veterinarian before giving your dog any medication.

### 3.6 Take your dog to the veterinarian for regular check-ups. 

This habit helps maintain good health for the dog. Your veterinarian can identify problems before your dog gets worse and has lasting effects on your dog.

> Advice
- Collect a sample of your dog's feces while walking.
- Lice control is essential at all times of the year.
- Avoid letting your dog smell or eat feces and other dirty things . This usually happens in puppies and will inevitably cause the dog to become infected with unwanted helminths.

> Warning
- Hookworms and roundworms can be transmitted from dogs to humans, so be careful and know how to properly handle dog feces. Talk to your doctor if you are concerned that you or any member of your family may have a helminth infection.
- Any infection with helminths, if left untreated, can lead to death.
- Worms can only cause a dog's heart attack if not detected and treated early.
- If your dog shows signs of fatigue or diarrhea and is vomiting, seek immediate medical attention with your vet.
