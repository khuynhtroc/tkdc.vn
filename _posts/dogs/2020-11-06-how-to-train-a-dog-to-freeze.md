> "Release" is one of the most important commands you can teach your dog. A good time to use this command is when your dog begins to like to nibble on things. Release the toy. Drop your shoes. Put the log down before entering the house. With the "let go" command, they will let them go out of their snout or at least you can easily get the object out of the dog's mouth. So how can you teach your pet this command? Refer to the following conditions to tame them.

## 1. Pick out training supplies

### 1.1 Use toys. 

Pick out a toy that your dog can easily grab with his mouth and let it begin to play with it. A stuffed animal with a squeaking sound or a bone are typical options. It doesn't matter what kind of toy it is because it's your job to teach the dog how to pick up and drop objects. [first]

### 1.2 Find something that rewards your dog. 

Remember that dogs prefer food over toys. Good food is more valuable to the dog than a toy. You can choose normal foods or special foods that your dog can only eat during training sessions. A dog's favorite food is chicken, turkey or cheese dry. Only use a small amount of food per session if you train them on a regular basis. [2]

### 1.3 Use the button as a clicker (the instrument that makes a click sound). 

In the early 20th century, a Russian physiologist named Ivan Pavlov discovered that dogs can be taught the behavior of "expecting" food by the ringing of a bell. This "stimulates neutrality," the sound of a bell, causes dogs to drool and wait for food to come.[3]You can use the same principles here as well. Choose an object that can be held comfortably in your hand and make a sound. Most people use clickers to train dogs. You can also use audio files in mobile phones. [4]

### 1.4 Use a specialized chain. 

If your dog tends to take away toys, keep them on a leash for easy training. If not, keep your dog in a quiet space to minimize distraction. Your goal is to direct your pet's attention to training, not teaching him to play.[5]

### 1.5 Please be patient. 

Your expectations must be realistic. It is true that dogs can learn basic commands in a day or more, but in practice you should not expect too much, pay attention to small changes in the training process. [6]

## 2. Train your dog to let go

### 2.1 Start training when your dog is about 3 months old. 

Each session should last for 15 minutes, 3 times a day. Usually, the duration of each training session should be shorter for puppies because their ability to focus is limited. [7]

### 2.2 Give your dog a toy. 

Hold the toy in one hand and hold some food in the other. Hold the toy in front of the dog's snout. Wait for it to sniff and grab the item or you can give the command "take it." This way you can teach them both picking and dropping the item. Remember that you must use the command consistently. [8]

### 2.3 Command "spit out" and give your dog some food. 

Always use a command line. You can repeat the signal twice, but do not repeat it too many times. Put the food in front of their nose and if the dog drops the object to choose the food you are doing it right. [9]
- If you decide to use the button then now is the right time. When you say the command release, press the clicker. Ensuring that the command and the sound are heard at the same time, the dog will associate the "let go" signal and the click with the enjoyment of the food.
- Stubborn but slow tone. Do not scream that scares the dog. [ten]

### 2.4 Repeat the process. 

Keep the toy until the dog takes it away. Give the command "let go" while making a familiar sound and enjoy the food immediately. When doing this, move away from the dog. This way, your dog will think of eating whenever you hear a familiar command or sound without you having to stand in front of him. [11]

### 2.5 Performed in many different places with different toys. 

You can improve your dog's recognition of cues. Dogs are very intelligent. If you don't want them to associate commands with a single toy or at a specific location, train the dog both inside and outside the house and provide a variety of toys. If your dog likes to suck on a particular item, use it for training. [twelfth]
- Always use utensils that allow your dog to chew when the "let go" command is issued. Do not encourage your dog to pick up and drop unwanted items. For example, if your dog likes to nibble on your shoes, don't use shoes for training. They will associate food with chewing on shoes. [13]

### 2.6 Increase training continuously. 

You won't know when is the right time to train. So prepare food and utensils that make sounds. If food is not available, immediately provide them with what they are more interested in than food. For example, swap the TV remote for the toy they are holding. [14]
