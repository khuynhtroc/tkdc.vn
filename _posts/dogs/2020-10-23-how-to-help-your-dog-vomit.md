While it is not fun to induce vomiting, it is an important first step to getting rid of toxins from the dog's body. To help induce vomiting, you need to learn how to give hydrogen peroxide, take your dog to the vet and follow general guidelines for inducing vomiting.
 
## 1. Give your dog hydrogen peroxide

### 1.1 Determine if your dog needs to vomit.

Before helping your dog vomit, determine if this is necessary. If your dog has ingested any of the following, help induce vomiting at home:
- Antifreeze, if swallowed 2 hours ago [1]
- Chocolate [2]
- Grapes or raisins [3]
- Tylenol or Aspirin [4]
- Plants, such as azaleas and daffodils [5]

### 1.2 Take the dog to another area. 

If your dog is lying in his bed or on the carpet, take it somewhere else to make it easier to remove any waste after vomiting (such as a room with linoleum floors). [6]
- A weak dog may not be able to walk easily on its own. You may need to pick up the dog or at least get it where you want to go.

### 1.3 Give the dog a small meal. 

At first glance, it may seem strange to feed your dog to induce vomiting, but it is actually easier for the dog to vomit if you feed your dog a small amount of food. You can give your dog a small portion of canned food or a slice of white bread. [7]
- Canned food is easy for dogs to eat and tastes better than dry food.
- Your dog may not want to feed on its own. In that case, try giving the food directly to the dog's mouth to help the dog eat.
- Don't spend too much time trying to feed your dog.

### 1.4 Call your vet or animal poison control center. 

This step is very important! Don't try to induce vomiting if you haven't called your vet or animal poison control center. [8] When you call, give as much information as possible so your doctor can tell you what to (and shouldn't) do next. Important information includes:
- What the dog ate (poison plants, household cleaning products, chocolate)
- How long do you think the dog swallowed the poison
- Symptoms of the dog
- The size of the dog

### 1.5 Determine the amount of hydrogen peroxide 3% needed for the dog. 

Use hydrogen peroxide (or 3% hydrogen peroxide) if your veterinarian or poison control center says you can help your dog vomit. This product is available in drugstores and is a popular inducement to induce vomiting in dogs. [9] Give your dog 1 teaspoon of 3% hydrogen peroxide per 4.5 kg of body weight. [ten]
- Use a measuring spoon to measure the correct amount of hydrogen peroxide.

### 1.6 Give your dog hydrogen peroxide. 

Use an eye dropper or ear dropper to draw hydrogen peroxide into the tube. [11] As little as possible, the amount of hydrogen peroxide swept into the dog's tongue. [twelfth]
- Do not mix hydrogen peroxide with dog food or mix with water before suctioning a dropper. [13]

### 1.7 Take the dog for a walk. 

Walking the dog can stimulate vomiting by causing the contents of the dog's stomach to mix with hydrogen peroxide. [14] Take the dog for a few minutes. If your dog is unable to walk, gently shake or rub his stomach. [15]

### 1.8 Wait for the dog to vomit. 

When given hydrogen peroxide, dogs often vomit a few minutes later. If your dog does not vomit after 10 minutes, give him an extra dose of hydrogen peroxide. [16]
- Some sources have suggested that no more than 2 doses of hydrogen peroxide should be given to your dog. [17] Meanwhile, some believe that a maximum of 3 doses is acceptable. [18] It's best to call your veterinarian before giving your dog a third dose.

## 2. Take your dog to the vet

![Get-a-Dog-to-Vomit-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-help-your-dog-vomit/v4-728px-Get-a-Dog-to-Vomit-Step-9-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Take the dog to the vet. 

Even if you've helped to induce vomiting, it still needs to be treated by a veterinarian. Vomiting is just a quick fix and won't completely get rid of the toxins in your dog's stomach. If the dog is not vomiting, it is essential to see the veterinarian, that is, the dog needs something stronger than hydrogen peroxide to vomit. [19]
- Don't hesitate to get your dog to the vet.
- If your dog has vomited, take a picture of the vomitus for the vet.

![Get-a-Dog-to-Vomit-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-help-your-dog-vomit/v4-728px-Get-a-Dog-to-Vomit-Step-10-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Tell the vet what happened. 

Even if you have talked before giving your dog hydrogen peroxide, while the vet is examining your dog, you should still give information once more about what happened. Also, let your veterinarian know how much hydrogen peroxide you have given your dog and how many times to give it.
- If your dog has vomited, describe what the vomit should look like or show your doctor a picture of the vomitus.

### 2.3 Let the vet treat the dog. 

Your veterinarian may be able to use nausea stimulants and toxins that block the absorption of toxins. For example, a veterinarian might give your dog activated carbon - it latches on to toxins in the digestive system and prevents the absorption of the toxin. [20]
- Apomorphine is an opioid pain reliever that can induce vomiting. The drug usually takes effect after 5-10 minutes. [21]
- Xylazine can also induce vomiting in dogs. [22]
- Your veterinarian will determine the best way to treat a dog that has ingested the poison.

## 3. Explore other aspects of helping your dog vomit

### 3.1 information about substances you should not induce vomiting. 

Some substances can cause a lot of damage after swallowing the dog, if the dog vomits back up. Do not induce vomiting if your dog knows he has swallowed one of the following: [23]
- Bleach
- Pipe blockage products
- Petroleum-containing substance, for example gasoline

![Get-a-Dog-to-Vomit-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-help-your-dog-vomit/v4-728px-Get-a-Dog-to-Vomit-Step-13-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Watch for signs of serious poisoning. 

Helping your dog to vomit can be dangerous if the dog is too tired or unresponsive. If your dog is showing signs of serious poisoning, do not induce vomiting and consult your veterinarian immediately. Observe the following signs of serious poisoning: [24]
- Shortness of breath
- Looks depressed
- Convulsions
- Slow heart rate
- Fainting

### 3.3 Do not use ipecac syrup or salt to induce vomiting. 

Syrup of Ipecac was once recommended to induce vomiting in dogs. However, this syrup can latch on to the stomach and irritate the stomach if the dog doesn't vomit. Salt is also no longer recommended to induce vomiting, as it can be toxic if consumed in excess. [25]

![Get-a-Dog-to-Vomit-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-help-your-dog-vomit/v4-728px-Get-a-Dog-to-Vomit-Step-15-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Help your dog vomit quickly. 

If possible, induce vomiting for 2 hours after the dog has ingested the poison. [26] After 2 hours, the toxin will travel to the intestines, and at this point it will not be effective to induce vomiting. [27]

> Advice
- Reading a poison label is a helpful way to find out whether to induce vomiting in your dog. [28]

> Warning
- Sharp objects can damage the lining of the stomach or esophagus. If you know your dog has swallowed a sharp object, do not induce vomiting. [29]
