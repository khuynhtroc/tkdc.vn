> Puppies will have to learn a lot as they grow up. That means puppies will sometimes behave badly as they probe limits and learn where they are. You need to learn to respond to these behaviors and to reward and encourage good behaviors. Taking the time to discipline your puppy will help your puppy become a good dog.

## 1. Respond to bad behavior

### 1.1 Get started early and consistently. 

You should start disciplining your puppy as soon as you bring it home. Puppies learn very quickly and need to be told what is unacceptable to in your home. You also need to show consistency when responding to bad behaviors, otherwise your dog will be confused, and stopping the behavior will become more difficult. [first]
- For example, when a puppy barks at your neighbor and you order it to stop. Then it starts barking at the postman but you don't say anything. This way, your dog will not be sure when it should not bark, which is likely to cause it to bark whenever it wants.

### 1.2 Use reward training to encourage rewarding behavior. 

Reward training uses discipline to help puppies understand when a behavior is not correct. Any reaction from the owner can be a reward in the dog's mind, so it is advisable to completely ignore the bad behavior. However, if the puppy does something to reward itself (chewing on shoes because he likes it, for example) then this won't work. In this case, a short, affectionate statement would be more suitable. When your puppy does something you are not satisfied with, just say "No" or similar statements in an objectionable voice. Please guide it, not scold it.

### 1.3 Ignore bad behaviors when they're not meant to be self-rewarding. 

When your puppy tries to get your attention by barking, jumping, or biting your finger, it's best to ignore it. Guess what it wants to do when it comes to the bad behavior to decide when you need to. If it bounces on you when you get home, it probably wants attention. If you don't pay attention, your dog will know that he needs to act differently. Gradually, your puppy will learn that only good behavior will receive your attention and love. [2]
- For example, if your puppy starts barking at you, turn away and ignore it. Your dog will understand that it gets nothing for it.

### 1.4 Distract and divert your puppy's attention. 

Get your puppy's attention by making a loud noise. Clap your hands and firmly say "no" when you find him doing unwanted behavior, such as chewing on his shoes or squatting to pee on the carpet. The unsatisfied noise and tone of voice will distract your dog from what he is doing. Then, redirect its attention to the behavior you desire.[3]
- For example, if your dog is peeing in the wrong place, pick it up and immediately take it to the toilet you specified.

### 1.5 Use isolation punishment so that it is effective. 

If your puppy is behaving badly, you need to isolate it from whatever was causing the behavior and move it to another environment. You can place it in a quiet room in the house, away from distractions or take it out in the yard. Let it "self-reflect" for 10 to 30 seconds, then remove it from quarantine and act as if nothing happened if it stopped doing so (like not barking anymore). If the dog continues the behavior, wait until it stops.[4]
- Respond to bad behavior immediately and consistently. As soon as you see your puppy is not doing well, take it out of isolation. Make sure you do the same every time it makes a mistake.

### 1.6 Teach your puppy to stop barking. 

Ignore its barking. If the dog is just trying to get your attention, it will soon stop barking. But if it continues to bark even without your attention, find the cause and remove the cause. For example, if your dog is barking at the traffic out the window, pull down the curtains. If it still doesn't stop barking, take it to another room for a few minutes. [5]
- You can also stop your dog from fixing by giving him something to chew on, like a toy rope.

### 1.7 Prevent the puppy from biting. 

Puppies are very mischievous and need to know where the limits are when it starts to play violently. As soon as the puppy bites, shout "a". Ignore it for about 20 seconds after it releases your hand. When you do this, your dog will know that you won't accept rough playfulness. [6]
- Avoid jerking your hand away when the puppy bites. It will think you are still playing and will continue to chase.

### 1.8 Avoid using violent punishment. 

Research shows that violent punishment (such as hitting, kicking, yelling, or glaring) actually makes a dog more aggressive. [7] Never use violence to correct your puppy's behavior.
- Violent punishment can hurt and ruin your relationship with your dog. [8]

## 2. Encourage good behavior

### 2.1 Understand your dog's motivational factors. 

Puppies are a highly social animal. They want to be cared for and loved by you, whether it's just glancing at, talking to them in an excited, cheerful tone, giving them a special toy, patting and petting them, or giving them delicious food . Notice what your puppy likes best. Immediately reward the puppy for the good behavior he does, so he has a positive relationship with the behavior.
- Be consistent when you reinforce good behavior in a positive way. Your puppy will quickly find out which behaviors you appreciate and which are not getting your attention.[9]

### 2.2 Build a schedule of activities. 

Puppies want to know what to expect. Develop a daily routine with specific times for eating, going to the bathroom, going for a walk, and exercising. This way, the puppy will know what to do next and what to expect. [ten]
- A specific schedule will help regulate your dog's behavior. For example, if your dog knows that he will go for a walk after a meal, he may save his energy for it.

### 2.3 Assert your ownership. 

Your puppy will be more respectful and obedient if you show your authority clearly. To do that, give orders in a stern tone. In addition to training, make sure your dog obey commands. For example, make it sit and wait a while before you feed it.
- Give the puppy time to do the command. If your dog doesn't seem to respond to your commands, don't give in and give up. You need to let your puppy know he has to listen and follow commands. Show your power in a calm and assertive manner. [11]

### 2.4 Teach your puppy to go to the toilet in the right place . 

When developing a schedule, be sure to include a regular littering time for the puppy. For example, going to the toilet is the first thing to do in the morning, 15 to 20 minutes after eating, and often after lunch breaks or play. Puppies will understand when is the right time to go to the toilet, and this will help reduce the risk of problems.[twelfth]
- You can start by training your dog not to defecate in his cage if you are not planning to take him outside.

### 2.5 Puppy training . 

Teach your puppy basic commands (like "come here", " sit ", "saddle"). This way, when you see a puppy behaving badly, you can immediately redirect its attention. For example, when you see it running up and jumping on someone, you can quickly ask it to "come here". The dog will stop jumping on the person and run back with you.[13]
- Teaching a puppy some basic commands also helps keep him safe. If the puppy is about to do something dangerous, such as running into the street, you can order it to "sit" or "shut up" to run to it.

### 2.6 Find help. 

If you have patience with your dog but it still won't respond or respond to commands, get help. You can also refer a veterinarian to a professional dog trainer or animal behavior specialist.
- You can also enroll your puppy in expert-led training. You will learn some helpful tips and your dog will begin to understand what you want him to do with home training. [14]
