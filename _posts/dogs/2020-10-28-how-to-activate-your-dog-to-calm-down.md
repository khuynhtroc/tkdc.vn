## 1. Exercise To Calm Dog

### 1.1 Take the dog for a long walk. 

One way you can cope with your dog's energy is to take him for a long hike. Note that walking the dog on the street may not calm the dog. You will have to walk for an hour or run with a dog if possible.
- If you are unable to walk due to physical limitations, running back and forth in the yard after many hours can help. [2]

### 1.2 Play with your dog or play hide and seek with your dog. 

You can help drain your dog's energy by playing a game of snapping or hide and seek with it. Play in the backyard and throw your dog's favorite ball or plastic plate or have someone else hold the dog while you hide the treat behind a few tree stumps around the house and ask it to go find it.
- You may have to show your dog how to play hide-and-seek by hiding the treat in front of the dog and then asking him to "Go and Find" a few times.
- Items that don't have to be rewards, like teaching-reward devices, can also give you time to play with your dog. [3]

### 1.3 Invite other dogs to play or take them to your local dog park. 

If your dog gets along well and plays well with others, inviting a few puppies over to the house or regularly visiting a dog park are great ways to help drain your dog of energy. Make sure the place where you are leading your dog has a strong, protected fence. [4]

### 1.4 Consider sending your dog to the dog nursery so he can get the training and excitement he needs. 

Dogs can play all day to burn off energy and then relax with you at the end of the day. Check with your area's dog keeper to see if this can help calm your dog. [5]

## 2. Use Training Methods to Calm Your Dog

### 2.1 Use positive reinforcement to teach your dog to stay calm. 

Compliments and rewards can be a great way to teach your dog how to stay calm. For example, if you ask the dog to sit and he does, give him a lot of praise right after that so he knows he has done a good job. Say things like "Good job!" and petting or rewarding the dog. [6]

### 2.2 Ignore if your dog gets too excited and out of control. 

One way you can calm your dog is to ignore it. If the dog is too excited and uncontrollable (barking, jumping, running around, ...), do not accept the behavior. By ignoring your dog's behavior, you are knowing that you are dissatisfied. This method may have a quick calm effect in some dogs. [7] Try the following if your dog is out of control:
- Don't look at dogs.
- Don't talk to dogs.
- Do not pet or touch the dog.

### 2.3 Use leashes to teach your dog to stay calm. 

If your dog routinely jumps up or runs around the house, chaining it at a certain time each day can help. By keeping your dog close, it will be easier to reinforce good behavior and correct bad behavior in the dog. [8]
- Try chaining the dog again when the dog is most excited. For example, if your dog gets too excited when you have a visitor, chain the dog when the visitor arrives.

### 2.4 Consider enrolling your dog in obedience class. If the dog does not obey commands or has difficulty staying calm, it can learn a lot from the classroom how to be obedient. A dog trainer can help your dog learn to follow commands and stay calm when needed. [9]

## 3. Maintain a Calm Environment

### 3.1 Use baby doors to control your dog's environment. 

If your dog tends to run from room to room or gets excited while looking out the window, use a baby screen to keep him calm. By placing baby guards around your home, you can prevent dogs from running into other parts of the house. [ten]

### 3.2 Give your dog plenty of toys, including gnawes. 

Having lots of toys around will help your dog turn its energy into play instead of running around the house very quickly or behaving inappropriately. Chew is very important to keep your dog from chewing on unauthorized objects. [11]

### 3.3 Make a plan to create a calm energy around your dog. 

Dogs can capture your emotions and reflect your energy. For example, if you are feeling anxious, your dog can sense it and starts to worry too. To prevent your dog from influencing negative emotions, try to create a positive energy of calmness when you are around your dog. [twelfth]

> Advice
- Discuss your dog's diet with your veterinarian. Dogs with a lot of energy can stay calm if they eat less protein, but consult your veterinarian before making any changes. [13]
- Try aromatherapy to calm your dog. Not only can the oil be massaged, but certain scents can calm your dog. Consult with your veterinarian or general health professional about scents that can help calm your dog and how to use it safest. [14]
- Doing the task to stay focused can be of great help. Excessive dog hyperactivity can come from a psychological need and possibly a physical need. By giving your dog a task to do, you are eliminating excess behavioral hyperactivity and redirecting your dog's energy elsewhere. For example, asking your dog to carry a heavy backpack will help him focus on his backpack instead of getting excited about other things.

> Warning
- Do not speak in an excited voice or yell loudly as this will cause the dog to be agitated and hyperactive.
