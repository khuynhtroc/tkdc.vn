### 1.1 Take your dog to the vet for a checkup. 

Make an appointment with the veterinarian to bring the mother dog to see. Your doctor will confirm the pregnancy of your dog and check for any complications if any. [first]

### 1.2 Prepare a litter box for your dog. 

Make a nest for your dog at least a week before the expected birth date. Make sure to make space for your dog by making a comfortable bed or box with a towel or blanket.
- Choose a secluded place, such as a private room, to give your dog privacy and quiet.

### 1.3 Place food and water in or near the dog's nest. 

Keep food and water available near your dog's nest so it can easily access it. This way the mother won't have to leave the puppies to eat and drink.

### 1.4 Give the mother puppy food. 

Pregnant dogs should eat good quality puppy food that is high in protein and calcium. This will help her dog's body prepare to make enough milk.
- You should give the mother puppy food until the puppies are weaned. [2]

## 2. Follow the mother dog after giving birth

### 2.1 Keep an eye on the mother while she is giving birth. 

If your presence doesn't frighten the mother, watch them while she is in labor. You don't have to worry. The mother dog will have uncomfortable contractions just like a woman does when she gives birth. That's part of the birthing process.
- In many cases, puppies are born in the middle of the night while you are still sleeping. As the mother gets closer to birth, make it a habit to visit her as soon as you wake up.

### 2.2 Make sure the puppies are cleaned up immediately. 

The mother will clean her puppies as soon as she is born. Wait a minute or two for the mother to tear off the sheath and lick the puppy clean. If the mother has not done this after this time, you need to intervene and peel off the puppy's coating, then actively rub the puppy dry and stimulate its respiration. [3]
- If necessary, carefully tie the umbilical cord at a distance of one inch from the puppy and cut it with clean scissors.

### 2.3 Make sure the puppies are breastfed. 

Puppies will start to breastfeed 1-3 hours after birth. You may need to place the puppies in front of the nipple and gently squeeze some milk so the puppy can smell the milk and suckle.
- If the puppies are not breastfeeding at all or the mother is not breastfeeding, there may be something wrong with the puppy, such as the cleft palate. Open the puppy's mouth and look at its palate. The palate of the puppy should have a solid surface, without openings to the sinuses. You should check with your veterinarian if you are concerned.
- You may need to tube or bottle feed your puppy with puppy formula if it is not feeding or is unwell.

### 2.4 Count the puppies. 

After the puppies are born, count them to see exactly how many puppies there are. This will help you keep track of them better.

### 2.5 Do not remove the placenta immediately. 

The mother dog may want to eat the placenta, and this is not harmful. The mother dog is regaining the nutrients it has put on pregnancy. You don't need to clean up right away. If the mother dog does not eat the placenta, throw it in the trash.
- In some cases, the mother dog vomits after eating the placenta.
- Remember that each puppy has a placenta.

### 2.6 Keep where the dog is lying. 

Puppies do not regulate their body temperature well, so they need to be kept warm. For the first few days after your puppy is born, keep the temperature in the puppy's nest around 30 degrees Celsius. Then you can lower it to about 24-26.5 degrees Celsius.
- Light a heating up in the corner of the box where the puppy is located. If the puppy is cold, it will not move much. Check that the nest is warm and that the puppies are close together and close to their mother.

### 2.7 Take the mother dog and puppies to the vet for a checkup. 

Make an appointment with your doctor to have your dog examined after giving birth. The doctor will check to make sure the mother dog is healed after giving birth and the puppies are growing.

![Help-Your-Dog-After-Giving-Birth-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-a-mother-dog-after-giving-birth/v4-728px-Help-Your-Dog-After-Giving-Birth-Step-12-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.8 Keep other dogs away from the mother and newborn puppies. 

If the pooch is also kept in the house, make sure it is separate from the mother and her puppies. The other dogs in the house are also not allowed to go near the mother of the newborn dog. The mother dog can be aggressive to protect her cubs. This is normal, and you should not punish the mother for her motherhood instincts.
- The mother dog may also exhibit protective instincts from humans, so you also need to keep children from disturbing the puppies.

### 2.9 Do not bathe the mother immediately after giving birth. 

Unless your dog is soiled, wait a few weeks to bathe the mother with a mild dog oat bath oil. Be sure to rinse the water well so that the puppies won't come into contact with any residual soap residue from breastfeeding.

## 3. Take care of the mother dog

![Help-Your-Dog-After-Giving-Birth-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-a-mother-dog-after-giving-birth/v4-728px-Help-Your-Dog-After-Giving-Birth-Step-14-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Give the mother puppy food. 

Breastfeeding mothers need to eat quality puppy food with a high amount of protein and calcium in order to make enough milk to breastfeed. You should give the mother puppy food until the puppies are weaned.
- Feed the mother as she wants, usually four times the amount of food she ate during this time than she was before she was pregnant. Do not be afraid to overfeed your dog, as the production of puppy milk requires many calories.
- Note that for 24-48 hours after giving birth, the mother may not eat much. [4]

![Help-Your-Dog-After-Giving-Birth-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-a-mother-dog-after-giving-birth/v4-728px-Help-Your-Dog-After-Giving-Birth-Step-15-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Do not mix calcium supplements with your dog's food. 

Do not add calcium to the mother's diet without first consulting your veterinarian. Too much calcium can lead to the mother getting milk fever later in life. [5]
- Milk fever is caused by a significant drop in blood calcium levels and usually occurs 2-3 weeks after breastfeeding starts. The mother dog's muscles will begin to stiffen and may tremble. This can lead to seizures because the calcium level in the blood falls too low.
- If you suspect that the mother has a milk fever, consult a veterinarian immediately.

![Help-Your-Dog-After-Giving-Birth-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-a-mother-dog-after-giving-birth/v4-728px-Help-Your-Dog-After-Giving-Birth-Step-16-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Let the mother set her schedule. 

During the first 2-4 weeks, the mother will be very busy taking care of her cubs. The mother won't want to be away from the puppies for too long. It is important for the mother at this time to stay close to the puppies to stay warm and feed them. You should only take the mother out to the bathroom for about 5-10 minutes.

![Help-Your-Dog-After-Giving-Birth-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-a-mother-dog-after-giving-birth/v4-728px-Help-Your-Dog-After-Giving-Birth-Step-17-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Trim hair for dogs with long coat. 

If you are a long-haired dog, the mother should have her hair trimmed around her tail, hind legs and near the mammary glands to keep these areas clean when the puppies are born.
- A dog hair trimmer or veterinarian can help if you find it difficult or without the tools.

![Help-Your-Dog-After-Giving-Birth-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-a-mother-dog-after-giving-birth/v4-728px-Help-Your-Dog-After-Giving-Birth-Step-18-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Check your dog's mammary glands every day. 

Mastitis can occur and progress very quickly. If you notice that your dog's mammary glands turn very red (or purple), hard, hot, or painful, there is a problem. In some cases, mastitis can be fatal to the nursing mother.
- If you suspect that the mother has mastitis, take her to the vet immediately. Even if you take your dog to the vet for an emergency, do it right away. [6] , [7] , [8]

### 3.6 Know that the mother has a vaginal discharge. 

It is normal for a mother to have vaginal discharge for the first few weeks (up to 8 weeks) after birth. The discharge can be reddish-brown and run into a cord, sometimes with a slight odor.
- If you notice that the discharge is yellow, green, gray, or has a bad smell, see your veterinarian. It is possible that the mother has an intrauterine infection. [9]

## 4. Take care of a newborn puppy

![Help-Your-Dog-After-Giving-Birth-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-a-mother-dog-after-giving-birth/v4-728px-Help-Your-Dog-After-Giving-Birth-Step-20-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Keep track of the puppies still breastfeeding. 

Make sure the puppies breastfeed every few hours for the first few weeks. They will eat at least every 2-4 hours. Well-fed puppies will sleep well; if the puppies make a lot of noise, they probably lack nutrition. You can check for small, round fat tummy and smooth fur which are signs that the puppies are well cared for.
- You can electronically weigh your puppies to make sure they gain weight every day. Your puppy will gain twice as much weight after the first week. [ten]
- Do not ignore puppies that look thinner or more passive than others of their age. Take it to your vet right away. The puppy may need complementary feeding or other treatment.

![Help-Your-Dog-After-Giving-Birth-Step-21]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-a-mother-dog-after-giving-birth/v4-728px-Help-Your-Dog-After-Giving-Birth-Step-21-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 4.2 Watch for any abnormalities in the puppies. 

If you notice that all puppies are growing up after the first few days, only one puppy looks still small and thin, which could be a sign of malnutrition or another problem. You need to take him to the vet for immediate examination. A newborn dog, like a newborn baby, can become sick and dehydrated very quickly.

![Help-Your-Dog-After-Giving-Birth-Step-22]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-a-mother-dog-after-giving-birth/v4-728px-Help-Your-Dog-After-Giving-Birth-Step-22-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 4.3 Keep the newborn dog nest clean. 

As the puppies get older and move more, their bedding will get dirty. You need to clean the puppies at least 2-3 times a day to keep their nest clean.

![Help-Your-Dog-After-Giving-Birth-Step-23]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-a-mother-dog-after-giving-birth/v4-728px-Help-Your-Dog-After-Giving-Birth-Step-23-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 4.4 Pet the puppy to communicate with them. 

Puppies need healthy communication with the new world around them, including acquaintances with people. Take the puppy in your hand a few times a day. Get your puppies accustomed to full body touch so they won't become unfamiliar as they grow up.

![Help-Your-Dog-After-Giving-Birth-Step-24]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-take-care-of-a-mother-dog-after-giving-birth/v4-728px-Help-Your-Dog-After-Giving-Birth-Step-24-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 4.5 Wait until the puppies are eight weeks old to let them go. 

If you want to sell or give away your puppies, wait until they are 8 weeks old before giving them to a new owner. In some states in the US, such as California, it is illegal to sell or give away puppies before they are 8 weeks old.
- Puppies need to be completely weaned and able to eat dog food on their own before moving into a new home.
- The initiation of deworming and the puppy vaccination should be done before the puppies go. You can always consult your veterinarian for advice and follow your doctor's advice.
