If you don't prepare before playing, you can cause behavior problems like snapping or biting.

## 1. Prepare to play

### 1.1 Choose a good time to play. 

Choose a time when your dog is energetic and hasn't eaten yet. You should wait at least an hour after the puppy has finished eating if you want to play gently, or 90 minutes if you want to do intense activity. If you feed your pet right after eating, he or she may experience colic or health problems (torsion) when the stomach turns and curls up. [first]
- If you have children playing with you, make sure they are watched by an adult. Your puppy may not be able to distinguish between play and teasing. When angry, your puppy may bite in mistake. [2]

### 1.2 Learn about your pet's preferences. 

Not all dogs share the same interests. Some like to run after and catch subjects, while others like to chew objects or explore scents. See what your pet likes and natural instincts. It takes time to learn your puppy's preferences.
- For example, if your dog sniffs the floor a lot, he might like to track scent traces. Also, if the puppy is normally just sitting and watching the ball fall, chances are he doesn't like playing fetch.

### 1.3 Train while playing. 

Add some commands to playtime. For example, if your puppy likes to catch the ball, he'll be interested in learning the "release" command to let you throw it again. Or your dog can obey commands like "sit" and "stay" if it knows that you will reward it with a game of fetch. Alternatively, you can incorporate a clicker (a tool when training a dog when it clicks) to train the dog during play. For example, you can click the clicker just before throwing the ball, have them "sit down" and click again as they sit on the ground. Then your dog will associate the action with the reward of the game of throwing objects. [3]
- Note that it is not necessary to reward your dog with food. You can give them more play time and care for your pet for a strong motivation.

### 1.4 Know when to end the game. 

Puppies are usually quite active, so you often don't notice when they are exhausted. Your puppy's bones and ligaments are in the development stage so they are quite soft. If your pet is exhausted, they can move abnormally and damage joints, so make sure not to let the puppy get too much exercise, and stop while they have some energy remaining. [4]
- When you stop playing, end so that your pet wants to play again, instead of exercising to the point of exhaustion. If not, the dog may become irritable due to fatigue.

### 1.5 Recognize the benefits of play. 

While play may seem like a recreational activity, in reality it plays an important role in adapting your pet. Dogs are fully playful and obey the basic commands, and reward more friendly and sociable. You can learn about pets and their personalities through playing games. You will also find out what upsets or frightens your dog.
- Having fun not only helps you bond with your pet, but also gives you an opportunity to practice. Play also has a stimulating effect on your dog. [5]

## 2. Choose a game

### 2.1 Playing tug. 

Use a zipper, and do not use household items such as footwear. If your dog is using furniture other than toys, he will assume he is allowed to play with things in the house. You should only pull lightly on the cord, otherwise the puppy's teeth may be damaged. If your puppy is under one year old, be extra careful while playing. Puppies with soft cartilage are easily damaged at the top of their heads.
- Some people believe that tug of war makes pets possessive. So you should not play this game with large breeds of guard guard. Their physical strength and protective instincts can cause them to exercise dominant behavior. [6]
- Tug of war is beneficial for a shy or anxious puppy. Let them win the game to boost their confidence. [7]
- Another alternative to tug of war is high jump. You will hold your dog's favorite toy / food high above their head and say â€œJump! Jump up! " After the dog has jumped, you must give the item to him to avoid making him angry.

### 2.2 Play hide and seek. 

Ask your puppy to "sit" and "stay." Show the treat in front of the pet and hide it. Call your pet's name while you are hiding. They will scour through until they find you. This game trains the puppy to come close to hearing calls and how to find the owner in hiding and practice his sense of smell.
- If your dog does not obey the command to "stay" before you go to hiding place, you can use the command "wait." [8]

### 2.3 Play object-picking. 

Hold the ball or toy in front of the puppy and ask to "sit" or "wait". Throw the ball a short distance away and encourage your pet to run for a toy, but bring it to you. Train your puppy's skills by chanting "take away" and "bring here" slogans as well as praising them after each successful execution. End the game while the pet is still interested to assert your control.
- Throwing games train pets to return objects on command, an important skill to help ensure their safety. Once your dog has a toy you picked up, you can offer a high value reward. Give the command "release" as soon as they release the toy and reward the pet. [9]
- Do not throw the bat during fetch. The puppy may accidentally touch the stick resulting in serious injury. [ten]

### 2.4 Teach your puppy a few tricks. 

Once your puppy has mastered the basic commands, you can teach him something like rolling or pretending to die. Set aside 10 minutes per session and reward the puppy for the correct trick. [11] For example, you can make a request, like shaking hands, and reward your puppy every time he performs the correct action several times in succession. You can then start to issue the command "shake hands."
- Performances work to train the puppy's mind, increase concentration and develop bond between the owner and the pet. You shouldn't let your puppy do too much of something, just practice regularly and finish the session at the peak.
- Alternatively, you can use a brain teaser to show your puppy where the toy, family members and litter box are, and then hide items, such as car keys and love. dog bridge "looking for".
