## 1. Negotiate in a friendly way

### 1.1 Find a good time to visit a neighbor's house. 

You need to set the stage for a pleasant conversation without giving your neighbor a wary attitude. The best way to do this is to meet at a time when they don't feel surprised. During the first meeting, remember to suggest finding a time that is convenient for both parties to talk. If they happily agree, you can fix the problem in a day.
- You could try going to your neighbor's house on a Saturday morning when you hear them gardening. Don't enter their property uninvited, and try not to startle or surprise them. Start a conversation with a few social questions, then ask if they have time to talk about the dog.
- If your neighbor gets angry or intimidates aggressively, give up on dealing with it on your own. Go to the police station to report a dog barking and a neighbor is threatening you because of your courtesy and simple offer.

### 1.2 Let's say your neighbor doesn't know about this. 

They may not know that their dog is barking or do not know what to do with it. A friendly reminder, accompanied by a clever mention of dog care techniques, even mentioning a dog trainer you know is probably enough. The neighbor may not be aware that their dog is causing trouble, possibly barking when they have left home to go to work. [first]

### 1.3 Let the neighbor solve the problem. 

After the first conversation, the neighbor may feel guilty and want to take action. Letting them take care of themselves will help you maintain the neighborly relationship. They may have a strategy to teach dogs to stop barking but have not had time to do so.
- Give your neighbor time to make a change. Timing and training your dog to stop barking takes time.

### 1.4 Talk for a second time. 

The neighbor is most likely either reluctant (not actively acting), or challenging (frustrated by someone else offering to do something). This forces you to take the next action. However, you should be as leisurely as possible. Talk during the day and in public, such as Saturday mornings while working in the yard, to stay safe and let everyone know. [2]

### 1.5 Provide suggestions for strategies to prevent dogs from barking. 

There are many ways to prevent a dog from barking , including daily exercise and training sessions. Explore a few options and offer courtesy to a neighbor.[3] Try to treat the issue as a negotiation on mutually acceptable terms. This will protect you from the law if it turns into an irreconcilable dispute. [4]
- If your neighbor is willing to follow your ideas, and you are also willing to make a cost / effort contribution, you can offer to pay for a barking collar, or help them find a good trainer. But of course you have no responsibility to do so.

### 1.6 Make friends with the dog. 

You may find that getting to know the animal is easier than getting to know your neighbor. Ask the dog's name and ask its owner to introduce you to it. If your dog has gotten to know you, it may stop barking at you. The next time your dog barks, try calling his name in a firm voice. If the dog's owner gives him permission, give him a nice toy or treat to show his friendliness and soothe him.
- If you have developed a strong bond with your neighbor and their dog, you can also ask them to let you take your dog for a walk during the day - for example if the dog barks in the afternoon, when the owner of it goes to work. [5]
- However, it is up to you to choose which way to behave. You don't need to do this if you don't like your dog, don't want to accept responsibility for taking care of it, or you are busy taking care of your dog. You absolutely do not need to offer to help your neighbor's noisy dog.

### 1.7 Send a final complaint. 

If your neighbor ignores your offer, see them again. Let them know that you've talked about barking a few times, but nothing improved. You can talk to them privately, but should also let other neighbors know if necessary. At this point you probably don't need to threaten the police unless they act violently or make threats.

### 1.8 Keep track of how things are going. 

Continue to gather evidence while you wait. Give your neighbor time to find a solution, but be prepared for the next step if this doesn't work. Keep detailed notes about the times the dog barked and how long it will last, or talk to another neighbor who is just as bothered. If the dog's owner does not seem to be able to deal with it, you also have evidence on hand to proceed with. [6]

## 2. Assert your rights

![Deal-With-a-Neighbor's-Barking-Dog-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-deal-with-a-neighbor's-barking-dog/v4-728px-Deal-With-a-Neighbor's-Barking-Dog-Step-9.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Learn the rules. 

Reporting to authorities is the last resort to dog barking, because it takes time and effort to come up with an acceptable solution, and certainly also makes neighbor relationships the least. will also be uncomfortable - and more likely to become outwardly hostile. However, if you run out of options and / or can't find any other solution, you need to know your rights and how to assert them. [7]
- Some places have specific rules about barking dogs, while in others this is considered a nuisance or a noise violation. Each region has its own different rules, so please contact your local authorities to stay informed. [8]
- If you and your neighbor are in the same neighborhood, there may be a rule for barking dogs in the nest. Likewise, if you and your neighbor are renters (especially if both are renting from the same landlord), review the tenancy terms. [9]
- Some places have out of court (binding or non-binding) mediation services. You can contact your local government, the attorney's office or the small claims court to inquire about this. [ten]

### 2.2 Call animal control. 

Now there are no more dog catchers coming in unannounced and catching the problem dog, but a local animal control service can intervene for you. Contact them to find out if they handle annoying dog barking, or if you have to call the police first.
- You may need to persevere in calling multiple times and / or providing evidence that your neighbor's dog is a nuisance so that animal control has a basis for action. [11]
- Call animal control right away if the dog is barking because of pain, is trapped in a small area, has been chained, or has no access to drinking water. Contact the dog owner first if you are comfortable. Don't ignore a troubled dog that is not cared for properly.

### 2.3 Call the police. 

Calling the police in can cause tension to suddenly escalate, or it can be quick to resolve the problem. How the results differ is up to your pre-preparation.
- Once you understand the regulations regarding dogs / noise / annoying behavior in your area, call the police on a non-emergency number to report the violation.
- Unless the local police only use an emergency number (113), do not call to complain about barking dogs. You may be considered to have missed another emergency call.
- Many police departments and other services require you to prove that the barking must reach an unacceptable level before they can act. This is where your evidence (notebooks, tapes, other neighbors' statements, etc.) come into force to support your complaint. [twelfth]
- Once the police are involved, your neighbor may feel surrounded and will try to attribute the problem to a disagreement between the neighbor that you were at fault first. This is why you should never give weapons against you by threatening, yelling, swearing or approaching the dog by any means, etc. [13]

### 2.4 Pursue legal action. 

If you have to go to court to prove a noise / disturbance violation, take the evidence you have gathered. Stay calm and speak clearly about your situation.
- You can also take your neighbor to court on small cases because they have lost your right to enjoy your home and residential space. You won't make a lot of money from the lawsuit (and may even lose money from the lawsuit), but if you provide clear evidence, you can force a neighbor to keep the dog quiet. [14]
- If you find that your locality lacks regulations on annoying dogs, you can make a petition and send it to your local leader.

## 3. Deal with minimal dog barking

![Deal-With-a-Neighbor's-Barking-Dog-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-deal-with-a-neighbor's-barking-dog/v4-728px-Deal-With-a-Neighbor's-Barking-Dog-Step-13.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Consider the situation. 

Unless you live far from a residential area, there is no way you can stop a dog barking at one time or another. To bark is a dog's instinct; they bark to show fear or anxiety, to attract attention, or to pain or illness, and for many other reasons.[15]
- Before you decide to act, think about whether your dog barking limit is reasonable and feasible. If the dog only hums a few hours when someone or another dog passes by, whines when it is about to return, or barks while playing with the owner in the yard, the noise will probably settle down quickly.
- However, if the barking persists (barking continuously for 10 minutes or more), it sounds like the dog is injured, sick, or makes you feel threatened, there is a legal reason to act.

### 3.2 Consider using sound insulation. 

There are many ways to silence your neighbor's dog and other annoying sounds. Installing soundproof windows can be an expensive option, but you can lower your air conditioner or heater electricity bills. Also, soundproof curtains can be a less expensive option. Soundproofing also has the benefit of reducing noise that you have no way to block, such as late night traffic and car horns.
- You should see a significant reduction in dog barking after taking steps to reduce noise entering your living space.

![Deal-With-a-Neighbor's-Barking-Dog-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-deal-with-a-neighbor's-barking-dog/v4-728px-Deal-With-a-Neighbor's-Barking-Dog-Step-15.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Install dog barking ultrasonic devices. 

There are devices on the market that emit a loud sound stream with a high pitch when a barking sound is detected. The sound is beyond human hearing, but annoying enough to teach dogs to stop barking. This basically works like a dog training whistle, and actually using a dog whistle might be helpful.
- If you can convince your neighbor, you can ask them to use a dog necklace with an ultrasonic device or a necklace that emits an unpleasant odor, or a whistle from a compressed air tank.
- The effectiveness of these devices is still questionable, and while they are not harmful to dogs, they may be annoying to humans to some extent (even if the dog drives you crazy!)[16]

> Advice
- Always show proper respect every time you interact with a neighbor, no matter how rude they behave. The escalating tension will not solve the problem and may provoke them to react violently.

> Warning
- Never ignore the neighbor and handle the dog yourself. This can put you in great trouble with the law, especially if you hurt the dog.
- Do not threaten the police, because this action causes hostility between the two sides. It is always your right to alert the police if other means do not work, but do not use this as a threat.
- Do not wake up the neighbor in the middle of the night to complain about the dog. They may get angry and will not want to be resolved.
