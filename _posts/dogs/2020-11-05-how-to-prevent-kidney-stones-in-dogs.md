> Dogs often develop kidney stones when the urine accumulates too much mineral salts - substances that are usually passed out in the urine. Mineral salts will form stones in the urinary tract or kidneys. The cause of kidney stones can also be urinary tract infection, kidney infection, medications, age, diet or depending on the breed of the dog. Nephrolithiasis and Uroliths are the two names for kidney and urinary stones respectively. [1] After you learn about the risk of kidney stones in your dog, there are steps you can take to help prevent the disease.

## 1. Give your dog enough fluids

### 1.1 Make sure your dog is drinking enough cool, clean water. 

Water helps to thin the urine, thereby dissolving the minerals that are deposited in the urine. Drinking enough water also helps the dog to urinate regularly and push the minerals out of the body. [2]
- Change your dog's water every day and rinse the bowl a few times a week to avoid bacteria.

### 1.2 Give your dog the right amount of water every day. 

The amount of water a dog needs each day depends on its body weight. Every day, a dog needs about 30 ml of water / 0.5 kg of body weight. [3] For example, a 4 kg dog needs to drink 1 cup of water (240 ml) of water per day. 10 cups of water (2,400 ml) is the required amount of water per day for a dog weighing 40 kg.
- Note that a more active dog, pregnant or nursing, needs to drink more water.
- Give your dog more water in hot weather. Always give your dog water that is cool, clean, and from a reliable source, especially in hot weather.
- Do not give your dog ice water in cold weather. Dogs cannot get enough water from eating snow or ice. In fact, eating snow and ice forces the dog's body to spend more energy thawing the snow / ice, thereby increasing the dog's water requirements.

### 1.3 Add water to the dog's food if the dog is not drinking enough. 

If your dog is a picky drinker or you suspect he is not consuming enough water during the day, add warm water to his food until the food and water are mixed. You can also feed your dog wet canned food to keep the dog's body hydrated. [4]
- Just make sure to keep your dog cool and clean, even if you need to feed your dog wet food.

### 1.4 Allow your dog to pee often. 

Every 6-8 hours, a healthy adult dog needs to pee once. [5] Puppies, puppies, or dogs with urinary tract disease need more urination, at least every 4 hours.
- If you are unable to pee your dog properly according to his needs, you can create a dog hole so that the dog can pee in the backyard, teach your dog how to use a specialized bathroom for dogs in the house, or hire someone to walk the dog several times a day.
- Watch your dog urinate at least once a week. The urine is thin and yellow, indicating that the dog is normally healthy. If your dog's urine is brown or red, or if your dog shows any urge to urinate abnormalities, you should see the vet immediately.

## 2. Take control of your dog's diet

### 2.1 Buy high quality dog ​​food. 

Look for food brands that contain meat first ingredients (not meat by-products) or consult your veterinarian. Although it is not necessary to give your dog a special diet to prevent kidney stones, you should still provide adequate nutrition for your dog. Your dog's nutritional needs depend on breed, age, and other factors. [6]
- Talk to your veterinarian if you are unsure about how to choose your dog's food.

### 2.2 Follow your veterinarian's recommendations for dog food. 

If your dog is prone to urinary tract infections or has ever had kidney stones, follow your veterinarian's recommendations on how to choose your dog's food. Your veterinarian will recommend a special diet (including special treatment) to help prevent kidney stones from coming back. [7]
- Foods rich in calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and protein often cause kidney stones because they can increase the mineral and protein content of the urine. For dogs prone to kidney stones, foods low in these nutrients (but still meet all their nutritional needs) can help prevent kidney stones from forming and may even dissolve small stones.
- There are many types of kidney stones. The most common types of kidney stones are Struvites (made up of magnesium - ammonium - phosphorus); Calcium oxalate (formed from calcium) and uric acid stones (speckles are susceptible to this type). There are even some types of mixed kidney stones. After analyzing the urine, the veterinarian can determine the type of kidney stone the dog has and recommend the most suitable food for the dog.

### 2.3 Talk to a pet nutritionist if you make your own dog food. 

If you are making homemade dog food, you should consult with your pet nutritionist to ensure an adequate and balanced supply of vitamins and minerals to your dog. Mineral imbalances (especially calcium and phosphorus) can cause kidney problems in dogs. [8]
- Your veterinarian can also advise you on how to meet all of your dog's nutritional needs through home diet.

### 2.4 Consider giving your dog a supplement that supports urinary health. 

These are dietary supplements that help dogs maintain a healthy urinary tract. These supplements often contain cranberry extract and are incredibly beneficial for urinary tract health. Cranberries help prevent bacteria in the urine from sticking to the lining of the urinary tract. [9]
- Supplements are available in pill, capsule or chewable capsule to complement your dog's regular diet. If your dog is sick, consult your veterinarian before taking dog supplements.

### 3.2 Understand the process of forming kidney stones. 

Kidney stones are caused by minerals that accumulate in the urine. The kidneys are the organs that make urine in the body. In some cases, the minerals made up of urine should be soluble but cannot dissolve in the urine, thus accumulating and forming stones.
- These stones can be extremely small or large enough to fill the holes in the kidney. Kidney stones, whether large or small, are abnormal and potentially cause damage to the kidneys. [11]

### 3.3 Learn about the harmful effects of kidney stones. 

Kidney stones can block your dog's urine flow and cause swelling if the stone is too large. A blockage in your urine can lead to serious problems, even death. Therefore, you should take your dog to the vet immediately if you suspect that your dog has kidney stones. [twelfth]
- Kidney stones can either invade the bladder or form in the bladder itself. This process is more common, and a dog's bladder can be filled with stones. Any place formed stones can cause infection and damage the kidneys or bladder.

### 3.4 Note that some breeds of dogs are susceptible to kidney stones. 

Some breeds of dogs are more susceptible to kidney stones than others. Know if your dog belongs to these breeds so you can watch for symptoms more often. [13]
- Lhasa Apso, Yorkshire Terrier and Poodles Miniature (Poodle Dogs) are dogs prone to kidney stones formed from calcium and oxalic acid.
- Dalmatians, Yorkshire Terriers and English Bulldogs (British Bulls) are prone to kidney stones formed from uric acid.

### 3.5 Understand the common treatments for kidney stones. 

If you suspect that your dog has a kidney stone, get him to the vet as soon as possible. Waiting can make kidney stones worse. Treatments for kidney stones usually vary, depending on the severity of the disease. Treatment for kidney stones often includes medications, dietary changes, and even surgery. [14]
- If you need surgery, you will need to hospitalize your dog until the dog has fully recovered from the surgery.

> Advice
- Some dogs adapt to certain types of drinking bowls. Plastic bowls sometimes cause skin irritation and contain bacteria. Ceramic or steel bowls are easier to wash off and cause less skin irritation.
- Regular physical activity such as walking enhances the functions of the body, including the kidneys. A daily walk also provides a chance to urinate.
- If you suspect that your dog's urinary tract has a problem, collect the dog's urine sample in a clean disposable container and take it to your veterinarian for testing.
- Make sure your dog drinks plenty of water. Drinking plenty of water makes it easier for dogs to prevent kidney stones.

> Warning
- If your dog does not urinate within 12-24 hours, you should take your dog to the veterinarian immediately.
