> When your dog is behaving badly, you will need to blame him so he knows the behavior is unacceptable. Instead of yelling or hitting the dog, use more effective methods, such as ignoring or not paying attention to it. Since most dogs love positive behaviors, your dog will quickly learn which behavior is bad.

## 1. Respond to bad behavior

### 1.1 Correct your dog's behavior. 

If your dog is not behaving correctly, signal or signal to him that he has made a mistake. You could say it "think again", or use a similar phrase in a cheerful but stern tone. You need to say in a tone that sounds like you want to ask it, "Are you sure you want to?" Your dog will recognize that tone and also the words you say. [first]
- Remember that it is not the dog that is deliberately disobeying. When it does something that you don't like, let it know it can't do it again. [2]

### 1.2 Don't pay attention to dogs anymore. 

If your dog continues to behave badly, stop paying attention to it by turning away or leaving the room. [3] Dogs are social animals and want to be the center of attention. Being marginalized or ignored will cause them to reconsider their actions. If you spot a bad behavior early on, it is okay to stop it before it becomes a habit. [4]
- For example, if you teach the dog a command and he refuses to do it, say, "think again" and turn away. The dog will find out that he just did the wrong thing. Then go back and repeat the previous command. If the dog still isn't cooperating, say "think again" and turn away. Continue to repeat the same behavior until the dog understands what is the right behavior. [5]

### 1.3 Avoid paying attention to bad behavior. 

Once you know how to respond to a disobedient dog, pay attention to reactions that will reinforce its bad behavior. Sometimes a dog's bad behavior is aimed at getting your attention. If you notice or scold a dog, being unintentionally rewarding it is with your attention. This will make it easier for the dog to repeat the behavior in the future. Remember that even blaming and scolding is rewarding for the dogs. [6]
- For example, a doorbell ringing might startle the dog and bark. If you ignore its barking, it will receive nothing and will not bark when it hears the doorbell next time. But if you shout at him to be silent, his bark will be noticed by accident and he will bark again next time when the doorbell rings.

### 1.4 Do not loudly or hit the dog. 

Scolding and whipping is not a good way to prevent bad behavior. Doing so will only scare your dog. For example, hitting a dog after he pee in the house will only make the dog hide where he pleased, urinating more discreetly and in a more clumsy way. This is not going to help as you will have to spend more time finding the dirt and cleaning it up. [7]
- Dogs do not understand reprimand by scolding and whipping. They will only be in pain and confusion, and this will make them increasingly distant from you.

### 1.5 Teach your dog to refrain from biting. 

Biting is a bad dog behavior that needs to be controlled. Teach your dog that when you bite it, it hurts others. When your dog bites your hand, scream, and let go of it, then move your hand away and stop playing with it for a few minutes or leave the room. Your dog will understand that cessation of play and inattention is a punishment for it. It will soon find out that violent play means the game is over and will avoid repeating it. [8]
- Fully-grown dogs can bite people through aggression, and without professional help, it can be difficult to train them to stop. If this is the case then you should contact your veterinarian or a dog trainer for action.

## 2 Prevent bad behavior

### 2.1 Identify the cause of bad behavior. 

Remember that bad behavior is not your dog's instinct. If your dog acts like chewing on shoes, breaking things when you are not at homeexercises or growling at strangers, it is for some reason that you have not noticed. Take a moment to find out why it acts this way. [9]
- For example, if your dog chews on things when you're away from home, it could be because he's bored or stressed being away from you.

### 2.2 Eliminate the cause of bad behavior. 

Once you've identified the cause of your dog's bad behavior, try to eliminate it. If your dog is barking at something that excites him, such as seeing a pedestrian or a car pass by, you can close the curtains.
- You can also arrange for the dog to lessen his startles, which is also the reason for many bad behaviors. For example, if your dog is startled easily for certain reasons, such as the postman, take him to the backyard every day before the postman arrives. [ten]

### 2.3 Reward good behavior. 

Use positive reinforcement when your dog plays properly, responds to commands, or pee in the right place. You can reward your dog with food or give him compliments like "good job!" in a cheerful tone. Rewarding should be given as soon as the good behavior has occurred so that the dog can relate the two. If you give the reward too soon or too late, the dog will not understand why it was rewarded like that. [11]
- Carry a treat with you to reward your dog for every good behavior.

### 2.4 Get your dog to exercise a lot. 

Dogs that are bored or sedentary are more likely to bark more than sedentary dogs. If your dog is indoors most of the time, he or she may jump, bark, or get overreacted when it sees you back. So try to let your dog walk or run outdoors for at least 1 hour a day. A lot of exercise will help your dog avoid bad behaviors. [twelfth]
- Give your dog plenty of toys to chew on. This will keep him active and occupied while indoors, and also prevent bad behaviors, such as chewing or chewing on furniture.

### 2.5 Make a habit for your dog. 

Dogs may behave badly if they feel stressed or confused about their surroundings. You can make them feel safer and more relaxed by forming some simple habits into them. For example, if your dog does not pee in the wrong place, you can start by training him to stay in the cage and take him out to pee in a certain place, eventually learning how to pee correctly. place. [13]
- You should also feed your dog and play with him at certain times. This will help your dog know when it will be noticed and cared for. It won't fuss and try to get your attention if you know it's time to play. [14]

### 2.6 Know when to ask for help. 

If you cannot determine the cause of your dog's bad behavior or his bad behavior is not improving, you should seek the advice of an animal behavior specialist or a pet psychologist. You can ask your veterinarian to refer you to a reputable specialist. [15] You can also ask your vet to do a physical exam of the dog to see if his bad behavior is caused by a health cause.
- Checkups are especially important in older dogs. For example, your dog may have problems with bowel movements, incontinence due to illness. On examination, the veterinarian will be able to diagnose and recommend medical or behavioral treatments for it. [16]

- If you are punishing your dog by isolating or stopping attention, do not make eye contact or make eye contact. Your dog will know that you are looking and will try to get your attention even more.
- Instead of punishing your dog for reasons like misplaced urination, watch for signs that he needs to go to the bathroom. If your dog misses the toilet in the wrong place, simply clean it with an enzyme cleaner to remove the odor. [17]
