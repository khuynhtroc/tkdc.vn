> When you are thinking about owning a dog, you will usually buy one to take home right away. However, you should not be in a hurry to act but need to learn the breed thoroughly, choose your puppies from a reputable source (breeder, ranch, rescue team), and arrange a house to pick add new members. In order for yourself and your puppy to have a happy life and a long relationship, you should take the time to learn the information and learn many essential things.

## 1. Prepare to Pick up the Puppy

### 1.1 Decide if you're ready to buy a puppy. 

They are cute animals and have cute fur, but need a lot of attention and care and cost more than intended. Bringing your puppy home when you are not ready or responsible for raising it is a wrong decision for both you and the dog. You should ask yourself and answer honestly to make a decision about whether or not to buy a puppy at this point.
- Do I have time to clean, teach, and train my puppies? Puppies are animals that require a lot of time by the owner, although some breeds are less demanding than others, you still need to schedule a time to care for your puppies.
- Can I afford to pay the cost of caring for the puppies? The obvious fact is that raising a puppy is expensive. You need to consider having enough money to buy essentials (food, necklace, toys, sleeping mattresses, etc.) plus the cost of regular and unexpected veterinary examinations.
- Are there any family members with allergies to dogs? If you have two or more people in your household, see if the other person is allergic to dogs or doesn't like pets.

### 1.2 Choose the right dog breed. 

You should research different breeds with some characteristics (eg a small dog, a gentle personality, etc.) that are compatible with your lifestyle. You can take an online test on AKC to choose your ideal puppy. Dogs come in all shapes, sizes, and personalities. Choosing the wrong breed of dog can be a hassle if you find that they are not suitable for indoors. You need to consider several key factors such as living environment (apartment with a private house)  and working time (fixed working time with frequent business trips).
- Consider the breed's energy level. For example, the Siberian sled dog is not suitable if you do not like going outdoors a lot. This breed loves to run, and they need hours of practice every day. Choose an adult puppy that will enjoy napping and playing with friends indoors, like the Cavalier King Charles.
- The apartment you are renting may have a restriction on the breed and their weight. Also, large dogs that need a lot of activity, like the Golden Retriever, will feel stuffy in an apartment. If you have large dogs in your neighborhood, make sure there is a large area with a fence or a dog park so they can run and train.
- Talk with an experienced dog breeder to narrow down the range of dog breed options that are right for your life. 
- In addition to finding out about dog breeds online, you can purchase books with dog content. 
- Remember that you don't have to choose a purebred breed, you can choose a hybrid dog instead!

### 1.3 Set a budget for the entire cost of raising the puppies. 

In addition to the initial cost of buying a dog, you need to list the amount needed to buy food, toys, cleaning equipment, and see the vet. This way, you will accurately plan the monthly expenses for your dog at home.
- Depending on breed and size, the monthly cost of raising puppies ranges from 500,000 VND to 1 million VND in the first year.
- Don't overlook the cost of buying sundries like necklaces, leashes, identification cards, and junk food. 
- Puppies bought from a breeding facility will be more expensive than adopted in a zoology farm.

### 1.4 Organize your furniture. 

The current home may not be ready to welcome new members. Just like with child safety, you need to clean your house so that the puppies are not in danger. For example, you can hide the trash or place it out of reach of the dog. In addition, you will need to buy a door latch in case the puppy tries to open the cupboard. 
- Cover all wires so the puppy cannot lick. 
- Keep medicines, cleaning supplies, and antifreeze out of the puppy's reach. These are chemicals that are toxic to them.
- If you have car parking, you should secure heavy tools on the wall. Pick up any loose screws that are left on the floor so that the puppy won't accidentally eat it.

### 1.5 Choice of a veterinarian. 

During the first year of life, you need to take your puppy to the vet regularly or at least once a year after one year. It's important to find a doctor with whom you are comfortable. Instead of searching online for a veterinarian's office, you should seek information directly from your local breeder, another dog owner, or local pet store.

## 2. Adopt Puppies from the Animal Ranch or Rescue Team

![Buy-a-Puppy-Step-6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-buy-puppies/v4-728px-Buy-a-Puppy-Step-6-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 See information about your favorite dog breed online. 

If you already have a particular species in mind, you can search online to see which camps currently have puppies that need to be given away. Some online resources, such as Petfinder.org, list adult puppies and puppies from hundreds of different animal shelters. You can search by breed, size, sex, and age to choose the right dog, and then contact the animal farm directly for adoption.
- Sometimes you have to run to the suburbs to find the breed you need. Consider expanding your search to the animal camps a few hundred kilometers from your home to find the perfect breed.
- Zoologicals usually do not have rare or high-class breeds. However, the rescue team may be keeping the breed (or a crossbreed like the Labradoodle) you are looking for. 
- The zoological farm and the rescue team regularly conduct behavioral tests (also known as personality tests) to assess whether the dog is suitable for adoption.
- Although it will cost the dog to have the dog sterilized, microchipped, vaccinated, and dewormed, this species in a zoological or rescue group is usually cheaper than a breeding facility or full. service individually.

### 2.2 Go to the local animal farm. 

If you are not sure what breed you need, you can go to the animal shelter to have direct contact with the puppies. When you arrive, you will need to gather information about your puppy's history and behavior. Also, observe the camp activity to see if the puppies are well cared for.
- Animal shelters are often a stressful environment for dogs because of too much noise, large numbers of dogs, and high levels of activity. Some will have behavior problems while in the animal shelter. The camp staff should let you know if the target dog has any behavior problems.

### 2.3 Don't be afraid to ask questions. 

Inquiring information at the animal farm is just as important as the hatchery. For example, you can ask about the origin of the animal (for example, a wild dog, brought by another owner). In addition, ask for how long the puppies have been in the camp to help with the selection. 
- Find out your puppy's medical history and behavioral characteristics while at the farm. Your dog's behavior in the camp will be different from his behavior at home. 
- Ask about the farm's rules for sick livestock as soon as they are adopted. Due to the limited health care budget of the farm, you should be aware that you may incur almost all of your puppy's medical expenses after the adoption.
- You can ask if the camp is a "no-kill" type. This type of camp does not allow animals to be euthanized after they have been in the camp for a certain time. 

![Buy-a-Puppy-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-buy-puppies/v4-728px-Buy-a-Puppy-Step-9-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 Learn the adoption process. 

Be aware that it is unlikely that you will be able to adopt the puppies on the same day you arrive at the animal shelter or rescue team. Often the staff will hold the interview to give you all the information regarding the puppy's history and basic medical information. In addition, camp staff will also conduct an inspection of your home to see if the environment is suitable for puppies.
- You shouldn't be too surprised when you're being interviewed as well. The staff need to make sure you are the responsible owner and take good care of the puppy.
- In addition to interview procedures as well as housing inspection, you need to fill in necessary documents and pay an adoption fee (usually from 500,000 to 1 million VND).

### 2.5 Do not despair. 

Sometimes the local animal shelter or rescue team does not have the breed you are looking for. However, they often have a constant stock of animals, so you won't have to wait long until you find your perfect puppy at the zoological or rescue team.

## 3. Buy Puppies at the Breeding Camp

![Buy-a-Puppy-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-buy-puppies/v4-728px-Buy-a-Puppy-Step-11-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Learn about many different breeding camps. 

Not all camps are well known, so you should consider and avoid some breeding camps when you want to buy puppies there. One type of breeding camp is the hobby exhibition camp. Such breeders often have extensive knowledge of each breed and invest time and effort in selecting the optimal and healthy puppies. This kind of farm usually only raised from one to two litter per year.
- The conventional breeder is less knowledgeable about the breed and only wants to make a profit. Do not buy puppies from a regular breeding facility.
- A commercial breeding farm usually includes several breeds and produces a multitude of puppies throughout the year. The commercial camp's physical environment may or may not be of good quality. In addition, not all commercial camps grant VKC registration. Puppies sold in pet stores are usually sourced from these farms.

### 3.2 Find a responsible breeder. 

Check with veterinarians and breed organizations to find a breeder with a reputation for good dog care. This person should only breed a few breeds of dogs and have good relations with the veterinarian or other local animal associations. You can find information about breeders online. 
- The responsible breeder will ask why you want to keep dogs, who takes care of them, and where they will be. They don't just take the money and give your puppies to you. 

![Buy-a-Puppy-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-buy-puppies/v4-728px-Buy-a-Puppy-Step-13-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Visit the breeding camp. 

You should not buy a puppy from a breeder without visiting the camp. Before buying puppies, you need to clearly see where they and their brothers and sisters are living and raised. A responsible breeder will encourage you to visit the hatchery and business to ensure you are completely satisfied.

![Buy-a-Puppy-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-buy-puppies/v4-728px-Buy-a-Puppy-Step-14-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Ask many questions to the breeder. 

You usually pay a high price to buy puppies from a breeder, so make sure the person is honest, knowledgeable, and ethical. You might ask the breeder a few questions: How are puppies raised and adapted? How do I choose potential buyers? The reproductive process is like? Have mom and dad been tested for genetic disease?
- You can ask for more information such as how many puppies a litter is in and how they received medical care (immunizations, deworming, etc.).
- Request proof of medical care, microchip implantation, and dealing with race-specific behavior or disease problems.
- Don't be afraid to ask questions. If the breeder has a good reputation, he or she should have no trouble answering all your questions about them and the dogs that were bred and raised.
- Be prepared to answer questions such as why do you want to raise puppies and how you plan to take care of them. A caring breeder will be very attentive to the health of the dogs they breed. You should build a good relationship with the breeder so that you can get in touch with them if you have any questions after adopting the puppies, or want to prove the breed later.

![Buy-a-Puppy-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-buy-puppies/v4-728px-Buy-a-Puppy-Step-15.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Registered for the certificate of the Vietnam Dog Breeders Association (VKC). In addition, you must also sign a sales contract. If you intend to prove purebred or crossbreeding, you need to have proof to VKC that you are the legal owner.  However, it should be noted that the VKC documentation certifies the breeds of puppies’ mother and father and is not responsible for ensuring that they are properly bred.

You should be careful of breeders trying to sell puppies just because they have proof of the breed.

### 3.6 Stay away from the dog farm! 

Such a camp often has a bad reputation for producing large numbers of puppies under poor conditions. The breeder who owns the dog farm is only interested in profit and has no responsibility for professional breeding. Dogs born in such environmental conditions often have genetic problems that can lead to physical and mental disorders that are sometimes not immediately detectable.
- When you arrive at the hatchery, you need to carefully observe the conditions there. If your dog is dirty, thin, or unwell, you should not buy it here.
- If the breeder is not willing to showcase their entire business, then it is likely that he or she runs a dog farm and does not want to show you their poor breeding and farming conditions. 
- If the breeder does not ask many questions and stops taking interest in the dog immediately after selling it, you should suspect that he or she owns a kennel.
- Breeders claim to have bred large numbers of purebred or "mating" dogs that are often dishonest and maybe running the ranch. These dogs are generally not purebred or mated.
- You can make a complaint about the farm to your local authorities in case you suspect that the breeder you have come into contact with has been harmful to the dogs inside the farm.

### 3.7 Think carefully before buying a puppy at the pet store. 

These shops can import dogs from the ranch. Ask the shop clerk about the puppy's origin and find out what the hatchery they mentioned. If you intend to buy puppies at the pet store, make sure they belong to a reputable zoological and / or breeding facility.

## 4. Choosing the Right Puppy

![Buy-a-Puppy-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-buy-puppies/v4-728px-Buy-a-Puppy-Step-18.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Get a health check. 

Puppies are usually ready to go home when they are eight to twelve weeks old, as this is when the puppies are completely weaned, can eat solid food, and are vaccinated for the first time. Puppies appear healthy at first glance, but on closer look, you will notice some abnormalities in their body. If you notice signs of your puppy being unwell, you should reconsider adopting it. The best way to check your health is to start from the head to the tail. 
- You need to thoroughly examine the puppy's body. If you don't know how to do this, you can ask your breeder or zoo staff, or rescue team to give you detailed instructions on the process.
- Examine the puppy's head. Look for signs that your nose should be cool, moist, and not draining. The gums should be a healthy pink color. Also, the eyes should be bright and clear with black pupils. The ears are clean and fixed in place according to the characteristics of each breed.
- Place your hand on the puppy's chest to check your heart rate. An irregular heartbeat indicates a heart problem that should be referred to a veterinarian. 
- Examine the coat. If the puppy is a purebred breed, the coat must bear its distinctive character. Typically, the coat of a puppy should be shiny and smooth without going bald. 
- Observe your extremities. The puppy's four legs should be straight without any structural deformation (eg bent in or out). You should ask your breeder or veterinarian to do a thorough orthopedic examination of your puppy.

![Buy-a-Puppy-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-buy-puppies/v4-728px-Buy-a-Puppy-Step-19.jpg.webp)

### 4.2 Learn personality. 

Whether it's buying puppies from a zoological camp or a hatchery, take the time to consider their temperament before making a decision. For example, you can keep track of how a pack of puppies plays. Puppies in the same pack tend to have different personalities, and you will choose the one that works best for you.
- The ideal puppy will be lively and cute. Choose a puppy that is playful and energetic, but not too aggressive towards others.
- Don't choose a puppy that is too aggressive or too reserved.

![Buy-a-Puppy-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/ways-to-buy-puppies/v4-728px-Buy-a-Puppy-Step-20.jpg.webp)

### 4.3 Play with your puppies to see if they are suitable. 

You should have plenty of contact with your chosen dog before making your final decision. If your puppy is bashful or tucks his tail on his legs as you get closer, then they may not be a perfect choice. If you love your puppy's personality but are not sure if he will get along with your children or other pets, you can take it home for a couple of days before making a decision.
- Remember that puppies can choose their own owners. The dog you are targeting is also observing whether it feels comfortable around you. 

> Advice
- Don't make a decision to buy a puppy in a hurry! You don't need to be afraid that they will disappear quickly and so choose carefully. When you find a suitable one, you will know immediately.
- Some dog breeds often inherit characteristic traits. Some of them bark very often and are silent often. Some breeds of dogs frequently run away, dig holes, or jump over fences. You should learn about your target puppy's characteristics before bonding with them.
- Do not choose puppies because they are "in fashion". Instead, you should think carefully and thoroughly before choosing a breed.
- Prepare all necessary items at home before buying the puppies (crib/mattress/cage, food, bowls, dog toiletries, etc.). Otherwise, you will have a lot of problems with bringing your dog along and buying things for them.
- Consider purchasing pet health insurance to save on vet visits. 
- If you have a dog in your home beforehand, watch how it responds to your new friend. The shelters or rescue team often suggest bringing the dog at home to see the puppy see how it responds and responds to the puppy.
- Consider signing up for a puppy command obedience training course. The sooner they are trained, the better.
- Puppies love to chew things, so buy plenty of chew toys to satisfy their taste.

> Warning
- Dogs are more likely to experience separation anxiety and show up when feeling abandoned. If you go out often, maybe this is not the right time to adopt a puppy.
- Puppies that are not fully immunized can have serious and life-threatening illnesses, such as viral infections. Only allow outside contact puppies after they have been completely vaccinated.
- Puppies raised by an unscrupulous breeder often have health and behavior problems that interfere with the mind and require expensive treatment.
