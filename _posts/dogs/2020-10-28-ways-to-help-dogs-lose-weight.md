> Dogs gain weight is not surprising. Many dogs can slowly gain weight over time. Not only is it a cosmetic problem, weight gain or obesity in dogs is also a sign of many diseases such as joints, heart, lungs and can shorten the life of the dog. [1] To help your dog lose weight, limit his caloric intake and increase his exercise.

### 1.1 Consult with a veterinarian. 

You should consult with your veterinarian before following a dog diet. Many clinics offer dog weight loss programs, so you can bring your dog to weight and get detailed instructions on how much to feed your dog each day. With a long-term weight loss program, sustainable goals and mental support, you can provide your dog with an effective and successful diet. A veterinarian may recommend one of the following diets:
- High-Fiber / Low-Fat Diet: This diet provides fiber that can be swollen in the stomach, thus providing a feeling of fullness in dogs. Choose foods that include the amount of food your dog should eat on the food packaging based on the amount of weight to lose.
- Metabolism-enhanced diet: This is a high-tech diet that provides your dog with a genetic improvement in metabolism. Increasing metabolism helps burn calories, which in turn can help the dog lose weight.

### 1.2 Determine how much food your dog should eat each day. 

You should pay attention to the amount of food your dog eats near the line. If your dog eats twice a day, you can weigh the total amount of food for both meals to determine how much your dog eats each day. On the other hand, if your dog continuously eats the available food, it will be more difficult to identify. Plus, it's also hard to know how much dog food to cut out. If this is the case, you can check the amount of food your dog needs to lose weight on the food packaging.
- The product's packaging will list the food by weight for most dogs. For example 300-350 g of food per day. If you want to lose weight for your dog, choose a lower than 300 g. [2]

### 1.3 Reduce the amount of food your dog eats. 

After determining how much your dog eats each day, you can reduce your food intake by 5 to 10%. For example, if your dog eats 300 g of raw mashed food per day (10% of 300 g is 30 g), you should lower the food intake to 270 g. Reduce food for the dog to eat for 1-2 weeks, then weigh the dog. With luck, your dog's weight will decrease. If not, you should continue to reduce the amount of food your dog eats by 5-10% each day. Continue weighing your dog after 1-2 weeks. [3]
- Don't be upset or anxious if you see less food intake or when your dog asks for more. This is a normal concern with every dog ​​diet. If in doubt, ask your doctor to prescribe a weight loss diet for your dog.

### 1.4 Give your dog healthy snacks from time to time. 

When you feed your dog less and increase his exercise regimen, you should actively and regularly encourage your dog. Giving your dog treats is also a good compliment. Just make sure to give your dog a healthy snack to help him feel full and satisfied. Here are the snacks you can refer to:
- Bran or grated vegetables mixed with dog food
- Raw French or green beans
- Apples (moderate)
- Banana (moderate)

### 1.5 Teach your dog to be active for food. 

You should teach your dog to find food for himself instead of putting it in front of him. You can buy toys or let your dog play with food. The dog needs to remove the pieces or roll the ball to make the food fall out. This game helps keep your dog physically and mentally active. You should avoid boring your dog when it comes to dieting. You should direct your dog's thinking to more interesting things instead of food. [4]
- Coaching is also an effective way to boost activity and avoid boredom. Training depends a lot on the reward, so bring some of your dog's dinner with you as a treat to encourage your dog during exercise.

### 1.6 Control weight loss. 

Every 1-2 weeks, you should weigh the dog 1 time to track the weight loss. This will also help determine if the diet and habits you are using are working. If your dog is not losing weight, reassess your weight loss plan. Make sure the goals you set are reasonable and nutritionally balanced. Don't expect your dog to lose weight quickly. Instead, slow and steady reductions are usually more sustainable. Within 1 week, you should not lose more than 120 g for small dogs or 0.5 kg for large dogs. [5]
- If you can't weigh a large dog, you can use a ruler. Select and measure a spot on the dog's body such as the bust or waist circumference. Mark the highest special and protruding points when measuring to place the correct ruler at that point for the next measurement.

## 2. Train your dog

### 2.1 Establish a practice routine. 

Not only do you start exercising, you also need to establish a training routine for your dog. An overweight dog that has never been active in the past should get used to the practice. Suddenly taking your dog for a walk every day can cause joint pain or injury instead of losing weight. You should talk with your veterinarian about your dog's initial activity level. [6]
- For an inactive dog, you can place some food in the distance and get the dog back. You can also play simple games like rolling the ball and asking the dog to take the ball. When the dog brings the ball, you can enjoy some raw food from the dog's dinner. [7]

### 2.2 Take the dog for a moderate walk. 
Light walking is an ideal exercise for overweight dogs. You can comfortably tie the leash to the dog's neck and walk freely. You should pay attention to the time you take the dog to walk on a path. Then, every 1 week, you can gradually increase your walking distance by taking another 5 minutes. [8]
- For example, if the dog is only able to walk for about 5 minutes during the first week, you could walk it for 10 minutes at week 2, 15 minutes in week 3 and so on for the 4th week, etc. Only a short walk, you can take the dog 2-3 times a day to enhance stamina and effectively lose weight.
- Make sure your dog does a real walk and prevent him from sniffing and sniffling the whole time you take him outside.

### 2.3 Increase your fitness level. 

Increasing the time, frequency and intensity of walking helps your dog increase its effectiveness in weight loss and overall health. However, there should be other activities to help your dog enjoy the exercise. When your dog is comfortable walking, you can give him one of the following exercises:
- Cycling: Once your dog's stamina has grown, you can let the dog run along while cycling. This exercise is effective for both humans and dogs, but make sure it does not endanger anyone or yourself along the way. [9]
- Swimming: You can allow your dog to swim for a while, then gradually increase the swimming time. Swimming is a great sport for overweight dogs because it does not impose weight and strain the joints. However, you should wear a dog life jacket, as the dog can become suddenly tired and risk drowning while swimming. [ten]
- Play with toys: Collect toys that help your dog increase activity. Balls, flying saucers or stuffed animals are ideal toys for dogs. You can choose your favorite toy and throw it over and over until the dog is tired. If you have back pain, you can buy a toy recovery machine to make it easier to pick up toys.

### 2.4 Actively motivate your dog. 

You should compliment your dog with his words and actions before, during, and after he practices. For example, you can stroke, rub your ear and say "Good dog!". Actively encouraging your dog to get more excited about exercise. Linking a reward with exercise makes it easier for dogs to be motivated and to perform. [11]
- You should be patient with the exercise program. It can take a few months for your dog to reach your weight loss goal. However, your dog will quickly lose weight if exercised seriously and properly.
