### 1.4 Change your dog's focus. 

You should direct your puppy's attention to something "nice" and even helpful. Does your pet like any toys or chewing sticks? If so, take it out so that it will no longer pay attention to the triggers of the fear.Turn stress into a good time. The dog will eventually associate the initial cause of the stress with the positive experience and will not be affected by it later (e.g. strangers, thunder, vet, or other animals. ).

### 1.5 Pet a pet. 

Each dog has a different taste and a different style of caressing. Some dogs like gentle petting, while others prefer to pamper and hug. One of the most common ways to cuddle isgently stroked the back.Place the palm of your hand on the top of your dog's head and gently stroke from the spine to the hips. Repeat this many times to calm your pet. [5]
- Be aware, however, that petting can be misinterpreted as complimenting your dog for fear. While it may sound counterintuitive, unintentional cuddling with dogs will cause them to become frightened in the future. Consider the situation, but sometimes it's a good idea to ignore your fear so they know there's nothing to panic about.

### 2.1 Dog trainer. 

Most dog trainers believe extreme anxiety, agitation, or fearThis is often caused by inadequate training.You need to reinforce positive behavior when training your dog. Teach them stress-free going to the vet, getting excited at a dog park, or afraid of thunder. You can do this by offering an alternate quest for the puppy to focus on and then rewarding the pet when it completes the task successfully. [8]
Example of dog training
- When you go to the vet, if your dog becomes extremely anxious in the waiting room, ask him to "sit down" or "lie down". The base command will take effect during this time. Then reward the dog after obeying the command.
- This helps reinforce the training and divert the pet's focus from the stressful situation. In the following times, your dog will associate the vet waiting room with sitting and taking the ordinary, not being examined by a stranger. [9]

### 2.2 Cover your own reactions. 

The puppy sees you as a member of the pack. If your pet sees you as anxious or scared, they will perceive the same emotions. If you're in a difficult situation, don't show your feelings. Take a deep breath and count each beat, then exhale slowly and slowly.
Example
- If you take your pet to the clinic for surgery and feel stressed, don't show this to him. Instead, create a positive attitude for the pet in these situations.
- Don't scream every time you hear the thunderclap, the dog will think something terrible is going on. Then they will also feel fear. [ten]
