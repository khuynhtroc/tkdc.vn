## How To Tell If A Dog Is Depressed?

## Part 1: Identify changes in behavior

![Tell if Your Dog Is Depressed 1]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-tell-if-a-dog-is-depressed/v4-728px-Tell-if-Your-Dog-Is-Depressed-Step-1-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 1. Watch for signs of withdrawn life in your dog. 

Normally, healthy dogs are very sociable and happy. If your dog is not excited to pick you up (slowly, with little tail wagging, less movement) or is no longer interested in his favorite activities, he may be depressed.
- Instead of running to the door to pick up passengers, a depressed dog may sneak away or find a curled corner and sleep.
- Pay special attention if your dog dodges you. Dog avoidance is often caused by injury, illness, or depression.
- On the other hand, a depressed dog may follow the owner everywhere but will absolutely not want to communicate with the owner.

### 2. Pay attention if the active dog becomes lethargic. 

Normal cheerful dogs are full of energy. You go a long way, the dog can go four times that distance and come back and so on. Your dog may urge you to keep pitching, and by the time your hands are loose, the dog won't feel tired.
- However, when depressed, your dog no longer pricks his ears to listen to your commands. Instead of getting excited about a walk in the park, your dog will tilt its head down and slowly follow you. When you stop to talk to others, the dog can sit or even lie down.
- If you are depressed, your dog may switch from being active and energetic to being inactive and becoming lethargic.

### 3. Pay attention if the dog is pacing. 

Wandering from room to room but still unable to find a place to lie down may be a sign of depression.

### 4. Watch for changes in sleep. 

Dogs often sleep a lot, especially when the owner is not at home. However, you should care if your dog continues to sleep when you get home or likes to curl up instead of approaching something that attracts dogs outside the door like a postman or a strange dog.

### 5. Notice any changes in your dog's diet. 

Dogs with depression may eat less and lose weight.
- Refuse to eat favorite food.
- Weight gain or weight loss.

### 6. Determine if your dog's destructive behavior or accident in the home was caused by depression. 

Dogs chewing on shoes, chewing on walls, books, furniture, or pillows are often signs of inactivity and can lead to depression. Dogs with depression can also be prone to accidents in the home. Don't get mad at your dog, but take him outside more so that he has time to poop.

### 7. Pay attention if the dog becomes aggressive. 

If your dog begins to raise fangs, growl, or become fierce when you try to interact, your dog may be depressed.

## Part 2: Observe your dog's body language

### 1. Observe the dog's eyes. 

Dogs often minimize their eyes by squinting when in pain, stress, or depression.
- However, some dogs have congenital "sad" eyes, not depression, so it's a good idea to diagnose your dog's depression.

### 2. Watch for signs of drooping or inverted ears. 

Depressed dogs often lack sensitivity to ambient sounds. For example, your dog will not pry his ears up when he hears attractive noises such as calls for names and collars, and becomes stagnant while walking.

### 3. Watch for signs of licking your feet. 

Dogs with depression may lick or nibble on their paws for comfort.

### 4. Pay attention to how your dog's head is up. 

Dogs with depression tend to lower their head when standing or sitting. While lying down, dogs often prefer to rest their chin on the floor or rarely raise their head in response to activity.

### 5. Watch how your dog builds its tail. 

When a dog is depressed, the dog's tail may bend down, slouch between its legs and no longer wag as easily as before. When you encourage your dog to wag his tail, he will only move it wildly and halfway.

### 6. Pay attention to the dog's overall posture. 

Dogs with depression have a tendency to passively walk, bow, shake their tail, and are lazy to react to your actions. You will find your dog sluggish and no longer interested in what is happening around you.

### 7. Watch for signs of hair loss. 

A stressed dog often loses a lot of hair. If the hair gets covered in your hands when you petting your dog or is scattered all over the floor, your dog is most likely depressed.

## Part 3. Know what to do next

![Tell if Your Dog Is Depressed 15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-tell-if-a-dog-is-depressed/v4-728px-Tell-if-Your-Dog-Is-Depressed-Step-15-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1. Make sure the dog is not sick. 

If your dog behaves abnormally, you should take your dog to the vet. Signs of depression and illness are often difficult to distinguish because they share common symptoms such as loss of appetite and inactivity.

### 2. Understand the causes of your depression. 

Healthy dogs will not experience depression for no reason. Therefore, you should consider whether the dog's downward state is related to the recent event. Dogs are often dominated by habit, so the cause of the depression is often a change in everyday life. The changes in habits that often cause depression in dogs are:
- Stress: Anything that prevents your dog from receiving normal attention can be stressful.
- The owner working at home suddenly went out to work.
- Get a new member (baby or puppy) in the house.
- Sudden departure of a companion (human or dog).
- Moving house.
- Go back to the old house.
- Upgrade and renovate house structure.

### 3. Spend more time with your dog. 

You should intensify walking with your dog and playing games he likes (stick throwing, tug of war). You can also try flexible dog sports, teach your dog how to play tricks, or walk to a dog park. When watching TV, sit on the floor with your dog instead of sitting on a chair. Whatever you do, make sure you and your dog are happy. Spending a lot of time playing with your dog is the most effective way to help your dog deal with depression.

### 4. Help your dog settle in. 

If your dog recently lost his closest dog friend, you might consider introducing a new friend. If your dog is left alone for hours, get a dog care service for several days a week or have a dog walker. You should also make a plan to take your dog to the park to help him settle in.

### 5. Reward your dog if he is behaving properly. 

Owners often fumble when dogs behave abnormally and this is a mistake many people often make.
- For example, it is smart to show your dog a tangerine when he refuses to eat.
- The best way to handle this situation is to put down the food bowl and leave the dog alone until the dog decides to eat. After your dog has eaten a bite, you can encourage him to continue by complimenting him.
- Encourage your dog to behave positively rather than negatively to help his dog deal with depression.

### 6. Give your dog a sense of security by upholding a normal routine. 

Try to keep the depressed dog as normal as usual so that the dog feels safe and okay with everything around him.

### 7. See an animal behavior specialist if your dog has persistent depression. 

Dogs may have a chemical imbalance and need to take some medications like Prozac, as well as participate in a behavior modification program to overcome depression.

> Advice
- When looking for signs of depression in your dog, keep in mind your dog's normal body language and habits. You don't need to mind if your dog is good, but will usually refuse to get up and bark at strangers. However, if the dog is social and likes to go out and suddenly gets up lazy, the dog may be depressed.
- A dog with depression while you are at home is not a good sign. Lack of interest, lazy walking the dog, or leaving it alone in the yard are signs that you don't really know what is best for your dog. Dogs are inherently a pack animal, so being left unattended every day, week, month, or even life is considered an act of mistreating dogs.
