### 1.3 Give your dog food. 

You may have to try it a few times. Dogs can sometimes separate the medication from the food in its mouth, then spit it out. In this case, you should try again. If the continuity fails, you can try a different method.

### 2.1 Crush the pill. 

This is only effective for crushable drugs. In many cases, you can crush pills and give them to your dog. However, some medications cannot be crushed because they are too bitter and can cause the dog to stop eating or the drug will be released slowly for 24 hours, and crushing can destroy this ability of the medicine.
- Liquid medicine wrapped in a capsule can be removed by cutting the capsule and squeezing it out.
- Do not crush drugs with outer covers.
- Check the medication label and ask your veterinarian if you can crush the medicine.

### 2.2 Mix the medicine with the food your dog likes.

Beef mixed rice is easy to digest and suitable for mixing with medicine. You should not mix the medicine with dry food as it is only moisture that makes it easier to mix it with the food.

### 2.3 Feed the dog. 

Do not overfeed your dog, as there is a risk that the dog will miss the medication if he does not finish all the food. [2] If you have a lot of dogs, keep them from fighting over medicinal foods. If necessary, let the sick dog eat it separately.

### 2.4 Use an infant vitamin syringe if the dog refuses to eat medicinal foods. 

You should crush the tablet, mix the powder with water, and then put the medicine water in the syringe. Then, pump the medication into the dog's mouth. The dog may not like it, but most of the medication will be given to the dog this way. [3]

- Place the syringe near the back of the dog's mouth to make it easier to pump the medication into her throat.
- Press down on the plunger of the plunger to push the medication out. This will most likely prevent your dog from spitting it out.

### 3.1 Choose another food your dog likes.

You will not be feeding your dog all the food so you can choose the ones you like. Show that you love the food and try to get your dog's attention. The bottom line is getting your dog to really crave what you are eating.

### 3.2 Drop some food on the ground while you are eating. 

The food you release is drug-free, but this will make your dog look forward to eating such a delicious, drug-free food. The dog will sit and eat and get used to picking up and eating everything that falls on the ground.

### 3.3 The first is pretending not to notice that you dropped your food. 

Another time, quickly get food back from the dog. This way, you will make your dog feel he has to act quickly to steal the food. This will encourage your dog to try to eat what you have dropped without thinking.

### 3.4 Drop the pill. 

Medication can be released alone or hidden in food. You should try to get the medicine back from your dog to trick him into eating it. However, you don't need to try to do this once your dog thinks he will lose his chance to eat.

![Get-Your-Dog-to-Swallow-a-Pill-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-give-your-dog-pills/v4-728px-Get-Your-Dog-to-Swallow-a-Pill-Step-12.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Get rid of other dogs. 

The process of deceiving the dog with the medication should go well without other dogs around. The other dogs are more likely to lose the medication, so separate your dog if you want to give it to your dog. However, if you keep another dog in a crate or outside and let him see it, the sick dog will be more likely to be provoked to take the medication.

## 4. Put the pill in the dog's mouth

### 4.1 Force the dog to swallow the medicine gently. 

Only force the dog to take the medicine when there is no other way to go. This is difficult but absolutely necessary in some cases. You don't have to be afraid your dog will choke. With just a little time and gentleness, your dog will swallow the pill more easily and safely.

### 4.2 Extend the dog's jaw from the back of the mouth with one hand. 

Then, use your other hand to lift the canopy of the dog's throat. Remove your dog's lips from his teeth to prevent him from biting. Take your time so you don't hurt your dog. Do not cover the dog's nose.

### 4.3 Open the dog's mouth wide and insert the medicine inside. 

Try to put the medicine as deep inside as possible. Make sure your dog swallows all the pills as much as possible. The freedom to put the insecticide in your dog's throat means you are helping your dog to increase his chances of swallowing it. If the medication is not inserted enough, the dog will most likely spit it out. [4]

![Get-Your-Dog-to-Swallow-a-Pill-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-give-your-dog-pills/v4-728px-Get-Your-Dog-to-Swallow-a-Pill-Step-16.jpg.webp)

### 4.4 Gently close the dog's mouth. 

You should keep the dog's mouth closed until he swallows the pill. At first it can be difficult to tell if the dog has swallowed the medicine. You should check later to make sure the dog is no longer holding the medication in his mouth. It may seem a bit difficult, but you only need to hold the dog's mouth a little to make sure the dog swallows all the pills.
- Blow gently into the dog's nose to help swallow the medication.
- Rub your hands over your throat until your dog has swallowed the pill to make it go smoothly. This will stimulate the swallowing reflex and force the dog to swallow the pill.
- Give your dog more water if needed.
- Be patient, calm, but firm.

### 4.5 Enjoy your dog's food after he has swallowed it. 

You should use high nutritional value snacks. Give your dog treats before and especially after swallowing. Dogs only really remember the experience of taking the medicine when they are treated later. Make sure to make time for your dog to snack on, especially if you need to give your dog a regular dose of medicine. If making your dog feel that taking medication is an unpleasant experience, the following times of taking the pill will become more difficult.

> Warning
- Do not try to put the pill in the dog's mouth if you have long nails. You can tear off sensitive skin in your dog's mouth and throat.
- If you choose to crush the medicine, you should not mix powdered medicine with all the canned foods because it is likely that the dog will not eat all and miss the dose.
- Check to see if the drug is crushed before crushing. Some medicines are not allowed to be broken or crushed.
- Do not heat pills or powders as this can change or destroy the chemical composition of the medicine and cause the medicine to become ineffective or harmful.
- Do not put medication in the mouth of a bully dog, such as a Pug. You may make it difficult for your dog to breathe during the injection. It is best to hide the pills in some chopped tuna.
