title: "How to know if a bitch is ready to mate?"
summary: You can decide to breed the bitch yourself or through a reputable breeder. In order to mate a female dog with a male dog, you need to precisely determine the optimal stage of the female's oestrus cycle to perform mating. This can be determined by examining your dog's behavior during heat as well as testing and monitoring its heat cycle.

In order to mate a female dog with a male dog, you need to precisely determine the optimal stage of the female's oestrus cycle to perform mating. This can be determined by examining your dog's behavior during heat as well as testing and monitoring its heat cycle. Once you have a grasp of the dog's optimal breeding time, the female will successfully mate with the male dog.

## 1. Check the bitch's behavior during heat

### 1.1 Check your dog's genitals. 

During heat, the bitch's vulva will begin to swell. Your dog's genitals will enlarge and protrude. The female dog's labia will swell up to make it easier for the male dog to penetrate. These are signs of a bitch's heat. [first]
- You can lay your dog on his back to check the genitals or watch him from behind. When you look at the dog's buttocks, you should see a swollen vulva.

### 1.2 Check for blood and fluid. 

Watch out for blood stains that have been spilled from the bitch around the house, such as on furniture, her bed, or on rugs. Blood or fluid stains are usually dark red, milky pink or white. About 12 days after bleeding begins, the blood will thin and lessen, and the bitch will be fertile. [2]
- You may also notice the blood or fluid has a characteristic odor. The strong smell of the fluid attracts the male dog's attention.
- In heat, some bitches bleed a lot while others bleed very little.

### 1.3 Note if your dog is peeing frequently. 

Watch for your dog's behavior as well as pay attention to how often he pee. If the bitch is urinating more than usual, she is most likely in heat. The pheromones and hormones present in the female's urine are messages for the male dog to realize she is trying to mate. [3]
- You will find that your bitch wants to be able to urinate more often than usual. This can be a sign that she is going through heat and has the highest fertility.

### 1.4 Make sure the bitch is of reproductive age.

You need to know if your dog is old enough to mate. Most female dogs should not mate with male dogs until they have gone through two to three cycles of heat. The bitch must be at least one to two years old. Some babies with elbow dysplasia should have an x-ray before mating. These x-rays will be sent to OFA's orthopedic organization for analysis. OFA will only accept x-ray results of dogs 2 years of age and older.
- If you're not sure if your dog is mature enough to breed, ask your veterinarian. Your vet will let you know when your bitch is ready to mate.

## 2. Test and monitor your dog's heat cycle

### 2.1 Keep track of your dog's heat cycle. 

Female dogs are usually in heat twice a year, so keep an eye on your dog's cycle to determine when she is ovulating (that is, she is fertile). Your bitch will go through four different phases of the oestrus cycle, respectively: pre-heat, heat, post-estrus, and heat. You may need to follow several of your dog's heat cycles to master each stage. [4]
- Pre-heat begins when a bitch's vulva begins to swell and bleed. This stage usually lasts for nine days, but can last from four to 20 days. During this period, the female can attract more than one male but will refuse to mate. [5]
- This is followed by heat, and this is when the bitch is able to mate. This stage usually lasts nine days, and bitches reach peak fertility during the first five days. The female dog will enjoy coping with the male and will allow the male to mate with her. The complete reproductive stage is detected when the female's vagina has returned to its normal shape and she is no longer flirting or accepting her partner.[6]
- The post-oestrus period usually lasts for 50 days, but can last between 80 and 90 days, and the final stage called the heat phase can last from two to three months. During the post-estrus and heat period, the bitch is at the end of her estrous cycle and will not allow mating.

### 2.2 Ask your veterinarian to apply vaginal cells to your dog. 

To confirm if your dog is in heat, your veterinarian will perform a smear test of the dog's vagina. This test will check your dog's vaginal cells under a microscope. This method is non-invasive and harmless to your dog. Your veterinarian will take test samples from your dog and may do some tests on a number of samples to confirm that your dog is in heat. [7]
- As part of the test, your vet will look for changes in the cells that show your dog is ovulating. A vaginal smear can also determine the optimal timing of mating in a bitch.

### 2.3 Your dog will be tested for a serum progesterone. 

You can also determine when your dog is ovulating by having your veterinarian perform a blood test to measure the level of progesterone in your dog's blood. This test requires a blood sample from your dog. Your veterinarian will likely need several blood samples to accurately predict your dog's ovulation period. [8]
- This test is considered to be highly accurate in determining the optimal time of mating of a female dog. It's an ideal option if your bitch has a history of mating failure or if you want to make sure the bitch is ready before sending her to mate with a male dog.

## 3. Let the bitch mate

### 3.1 Determine the best male dog for mating. 

In order to breed your bitch with a male dog, you will need to find a suitable target for a female dog. Find a healthy male dog with no defects or genetic problems. Before that, you should meet with the owner of a male dog or a breeder and discuss the dog's health status and medical history. [9]
- You should confirm the age of the male dog. Most mating should be done with males aged 1 to 7 years.
- Make sure you talk to the vet before your female dog is mated to a male dog. The veterinarian should clarify the female dog's health or other problems before initiating mating.

### 3.2 Bring the female dog to the male dog at the right time. 

Usually, male dogs are better at mating with their opponents in their territory or area. You can discuss with the male dog owner to bring the female to the male dog at the ideal time of mating. Set the date of mating based on the bitch's oestrus cycle so that the mating happens at the right time when the bitch is most fertile. [ten]
- Do not let your dog mate in the first heat. You should wait until your bitch has gone through her second estrous period to mate. The dog's health will be more ensured to perform mating. [11]
- You can arrange for your dog to mate twice, at 24 or 48 hours apart. This helps to increase the chances of the female being pregnant.

### 3.3 Create a comfortable environment for mating. 

Once you know the exact date of heat, bring the female dog to the male dog in a comfortable environment. Owners of male dogs should create a clean and open space for breeding. If the bitch is in the right stage of her oestrus cycle, she will join the male dog pretty quickly. The female dog will signal to attract the opponent, and if the male does respond, mating is natural. [twelfth]
- If mating is unsuccessful, ask the male dog's owner about the next steps to take. Professional breeders can offer free service or next mating sessions to compensate for unsuccessful breeding.
