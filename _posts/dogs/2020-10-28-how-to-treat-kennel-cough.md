### 1.1 Understand your risk factors. 

Kennel cough is extremely contagious. If your dog has been in contact with other dogs in the park or in a kennel it is likely that it has been exposed. [2]
- One asked: "Can a dog that has coughed a kennel be infected again?"
- Veterinarian Pippa Elliot replied, "Yes. Dog kennel is a general term used to describe a symptom but not the cause. For example, a dog has recovered from a cough caused by strain A. Then, it will have antibodies to strain A. But if the dog is infected with strain B, which is causing the kennel cough symptoms, the dog does not have antibodies to this strain and will again show the symptoms again. "

### 1.2 Hear a cough. 

Infected dogs often develop sudden coughing spells, which can vary in severity, from persistent, unresponsive coughs to dry, severe coughing. [3]
- A dry, coughing cough is often mistaken for a dog with something in its throat. If possible, open the dog's mouth to check for any bones or sticks in it.
- Another way to determine if your dog is choking on a foreign body is to give your dog its favorite treat. A chopped dog will not be able to eat it, so if it is not difficult for a dog to eat and swallow, there may not be any foreign objects in the dog's throat. [4]

- However, if the dog is unable to fight off the infection on its own, or if the doctor sees the dog has a fever or hears signs of blockage in the dog's chest, these are indications that the dog has a secondary infection from the infection. initial (may be viral or bacterial infection). In these cases, antibiotics may be prescribed by a doctor. [13]
