### 1.1 Give your pregnant dog puppy food early. 

On the other hand, you will need to let the pregnant dog gain 15-20% of its original body weight by the time of delivery. Puppy foods are high in protein and basic nutrients and will therefore help your dog gain the weight it needs. Keep in mind, you won't want to make your dog gain too much weight. You can start feeding your puppy when you notice your dog is pregnant, or if you know your dog is prone to weight changes, you can wait up to 2-3 weeks before the dog is born. (birth).
- In addition, you should choose the puppy food you plan to feed the puppies in the future. This will make it easier for the puppies to switch to their food - in terms of their general health and more specifically their GI balance. [first]

### 1.2 Slowly feed the puppy food. 

Start when they are 3 weeks old. You will not completely - immediately - wean the puppies. You will start by feeding puppy food with about 10% of its calories each day. They will continue to breastfeed, while getting used to puppy food. After 2-3 weeks, they will eat more food and they will breastfeed less.
- Do not quickly wean your puppies while they are still eating slowly. This can lead to malnutrition. It is better to let them continue to breastfeed and slow down the weaning process a bit. [2]

### 1.3 Encourage your puppies to eat their food. 

Most likely if you place the puppy's food in front of it, it will eat it. In rare cases, some puppies may refuse to eat. Just bring the puppy and put it in front of the food. Do it once or twice. In the end, the puppy will accept food. [3]

### 1.4 Separate the mother while she eats the food.

Start by separating the puppies from their mother for 1 hour, 2-3 times a day. Move the mother to another part of the yard or home. Leave the puppy in the food bowl. They will certainly groan at first. They will then realize that their food bowl contains delicious and nutritious food. You're mimicking the process in the wild, so don't feel bad. [4]

### 1.5 Keep an eye on the puppies. 

During the weaning process, monitor their health. Make sure they gain weight evenly. Check for vomiting or diarrhea. Consult your veterinarian if you have any problems or questions. [5]

### 1.6 Switch to mother dog regular food at week 4. 

As with all other steps, it is important to change slowly. Start by converting 1/4 of the puppy food into adult dog food the mother usually eats. This will help your dog's digestive system cope with the change and it will continue to provide the puppies with milk and nutrients. After a few weeks, switch completely to the mother's usual adult dog food. [6]

### 1.7 Completely wean your breast milk. 

Puppies around 7 weeks should be completely weaned. They should be given puppy dry food and water. [7]

### 2.1 Mix puppy formula with dry puppy food. 

You can buy this from any pet supply store or from your veterinarian's office. Soak the dry puppy food in formula and pour it in a large shallow pan when the puppies begin to walk around 3 weeks of age. You need to keep the food close to the puppy. They won't be eaten, if you use a wider and deeper bowl. [8]
- Formula will provide extra nutrients and help the puppy not choke on the dry powder when they start learning to eat.

### 2.2 Consider using a blender. 

For puppies, the food paste and formula is still too much. Use a blender to grind food until it looks like baby cereal. 250 grams of high quality puppy feed, 370 ml of formula, and about 470 ml of water, blend well and feed the 6 puppies. [9] After 1-2 weeks, you can start giving them dry foods.

### 2.3 Feed the puppies 3 times a day during the weaning process. 

Puppies under 6 months of age should be fed 3 times per day; After 6 months, they can be fed 2 times a day. [ten]
- Make sure you feed them the same amount of food at the same time each day. You need to create a routine for your puppy to eat according to a schedule. This will tame the dog's appetite and prevent him from yelling all day. When you switch to 2 meals a day, you can skip the lunch (mid meal).
