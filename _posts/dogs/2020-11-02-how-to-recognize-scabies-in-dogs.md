> Scabies is an inflammation of the skin caused by small parasitic mites in dogs. There are two basic types of scabies that are categorized based on cause and symptoms. It is important for the owner to recognize the signs and understand the differences between the types. Although scabies are very rarely dangerous in the life of a pet, recognizing this troubling illness early will make it easier to treat later.

## 1. Know the signs of scabies

### 1.1 Watch for signs of severe itching. 

Sarcoptic females often cause intense itchiness. Your dog may not stop scratching or nibbling to relieve itching. Dog skin is irritated by scratching and biting so it can easily become infected. The itch can be so irritating that the dog forgets about essentials like eating, drinking or resting.
- Severe cases of Sarcoptic scabies can lead to a number of secondary bacterial or fungal infections that cause white, scaly patches to form on the irritated skin, although this is not common in case. [1] In addition, dogs with secondary infections are more likely to lose weight, have a fever, and / or have swollen lymph nodes.

### 1.2 Check for hair loss. 

Local Demodectic scabies is less severe, often causing one or two patches of "loose hair" or hair loss. Usually this small patch of skin will not get inflamed or irritated and will not cause severe itching. [2]

### 1.3 Watch out for areas where the hair is thin or where the hairs are bare. 

When local Demodectic scabies does not go away on its own, the disease can even spread to the rest of the dog's body, leading to systemic scabies. Sparse or bare patches of hair will develop more on the dog's body, sometimes approximately 2.5 cm in diameter. The skin in these areas will become red, scaly, and / or hard.
- Dermatitis causes the dog to scratch a lot, sometimes leading to more serious infections. Some secondary infections can cause symptoms similar to those with scabies - fever, weight loss, swollen lymph nodes, and so on. [3]

Some cases of local Demodectic scabies cause Demodectic foot inflammation. This happens when the tick causes the scabies to go deeper into the dog's feet, which is difficult to handle. Your dog's feet will often become swollen and irritated. The symptoms are often worse around the base of the nail and are often accompanied by another secondary infection. [4]

### 1.5 Look for red, irritated patches of skin on your body or other household members. 

One of the ways to detect scabies in dogs is to look for tick bites on the owner's body. When the Sarcoptic scabies tick is transmitted to humans, they can cause red bumps that look like mosquito bites. [5] Fortunately, this symptom almost never gets worse. However, discovering these symptoms after being around the dog constantly scratching is a reliable sign of Sarcoptic scabies.
- Note: we are not affected by the type of Acari cause scabies Demodectic.

### 1.6 Note that the signs of scabies are likely symptoms of several other (possibly serious) diseases in dogs as well. 

- Itching or loss of patchy hair is also a symptom of other skin conditions such as allergies, Cushing's syndrome (secondary adrenal insufficiency), diabetes, hyperthyroidism, and parasitic infections. That is why it is important that you talk to your veterinarian about the condition in order to take appropriate diagnostic and treatment measures. [6]

Use your thumb and index finger to scrub the edges of the dog's ears. The movement should be slow, slow, and don't squeeze too hard. As you do this, notice the back leg that is the same as the dog's ear you are rubbing.

### 2.4 Note that the pedal reflex test for the ear buds does not give a definitive diagnosis of Sarcoptic scabies. 

This test only confirmed that the dog was itchy and sensitive and the cause could not be determined. Sarcoptic scabies is often difficult to accurately diagnose. The pedal reflex test of the earbud can lead to an established diagnosis of scabies, in which case you need to treat the dog as soon as possible. If the dog responds immediately to therapy, it can be seen as confirmation of the diagnosis. [8]

### 3.1 Distinguishing between Sarcoptic and Demodectic scabies. 

Dogs can get two types of scabies - Sarcoptic and Demodectic. While they are both potentially serious, the morphology of each disease is somewhat different from the symptoms they present (see Part 1) and has different etiologies. Sarcoptic scabies is an infection caused by a type of scabies spread from other infected animals. Demodectic scabies are caused by an unusual tick that parasites on the skin of dogs. Although most dogs can live with this parasite, ticks can sometimes over-multiply, causing hair loss and itching. [9]
- Although both Sarcoptic scabies and large-scale Demodectic scabies cause itching, it is important for the farmer to distinguish the disease - the Sarcoptic scab usually causes intense and immediate itching, while Demodectic mites cause these The irritated patch spreads gradually, after which itchiness begins.

This can be due to immunodeficiency, allergies or hormonal diseases, and if left untreated, patchy areas (commonly known as rubbish) may increase, irritate and become infected. infection, leading to itching and scab formation (scabies).
- Local Demodex scabies is more common in puppies. In about 90% of cases, local Demodex scabies clears up on their own in a month or two. [13] However, with a few cases, the disease progressed more seriously to large-scale Demodex scabies.
- Although dogs themselves are not inherited from the Demodex scabies parasite, dogs with extensive Demodex scabies often inherit the susceptibility of their parents to disease. [14]

### 4.3 Do not breed dogs with Demodex scabies. 

As noted above, dogs with severe Demodex scabies sometimes have a weakened immune system inherited from parent dogs. Because of this, breeders who are working on the long and arduous Demodex scabies treatment for dogs are often advised not to breed their dogs. For dogs with only mild local Demodex scabies, breeding is sometimes acceptable, especially if scabies occurs at a young age and has resolved on its own.

### 4.5 Understand the risks of spreading Sarcoptic scabies. 

Sarcoptic scabies is highly contagious and is usually passed from an infected dog to another. Usually an infected dog shows very little signs of illness (sometimes no signs). Sarcoptic scabies can be passed from mother to puppy and are common in crowded living conditions, poorly cared for, such as puppy production camps, dog shelters and animal rescue stations. [19] However, a dog can still be infected with ticks even without contact with an animal with scabies: when not on a host, the tick can survive for 4 to 21 days in temperatures between 10- 15 ° C, and 2-6 days in a temperature between 20-25 ° C. [20]
- A dog can get scabies from an object that has been recently used by another infected animal, such as a blanket or towel. Likewise, if dog and cat salons fail to regularly clean clippers, towels and cages, it can lead to the spread of scabies. [21]
- Since wild animals such as coyotes or foxes can also develop Sarcoptic scabies, [22] playing with dogs in wild areas can also lead to scabies.
