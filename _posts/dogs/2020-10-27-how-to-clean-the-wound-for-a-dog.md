### 1.1 Keep the dog alone. 

When you see that your dog is injured, keep it under control and calm him down if he gets too excited. Pat your dog by gently petting and cooing your dog. Be very calm on your own, even though you worry a lot about the dog. Dogs can read language and capture your voice very well. As a result, your dog can react to your behavior and obey you.

### 1.2 Muzzle if necessary. 

You need to protect yourself when treating your dog's wound. Dogs can be loving and friendly with you on a regular basis, but when they are in pain, they can get more aggressive to protect themselves from further harm. If your dog starts growling, snapping at you, or having a history of biting people from previous agitation, you should gag the dog to protect yourself.
- If you don't have a clear snout, wrap a leash or rope around the muzzle. [first]
- If your dog gets too agitated and becomes more aggressive, stop and take the dog to the vet immediately.
- Protect yourself by wrapping your dog in a blanket or towel when taking your dog to the vet.

### 1.3 Stop bleeding. 

Before cleaning the wound, you should do something more important than stop the bleeding as soon as possible. If the blood is bleeding profusely from the wound, the dog is in serious danger of trauma to the artery. Therefore, the dog should be carefully stopped bleeding.
- Press directly on the wound with clean and absorbent materials such as towels, rags, shirts, gauze, or even tampons.
- Press the wound for 3-5 minutes, then check to see if the bleeding has stopped. Stopping pressure on the wound can interrupt or hinder the blood clotting that is forming.

- Wrap a clean towel or gauze around the dog's feet (not around the neck, chest or stomach).
- Use a belt or lanyard to fix the gauze. Try to tie the rope over the wound and near the dog's body.

- Apply moderate pressure to slow or stop bleeding without affecting the soft muscles and tissues.
- Avoid hurting your dog while tying the garland.
