## 1. Grooming the Pug

### 1.1 Clean all creases on the dog's face weekly. 

The folds on the pug's face can become contaminated with food, saliva, dirt, and other dirty grit that stinks and causes irritation. You will need to use a cotton swab soaked in warm water to clean the dog. Wipe along the folds around the dog's nose and eyes, being careful not to let the cotton swab touch the dog's eyes, nostrils, or mouth.
- Don't let the folds remain damp after wiping, as moisture can cause further irritation. Use a towel or cotton ball to dry your dog.
- While it is recommended to do this once a week, you can clean your dog more often as your dog starts to smell.

### 1.2 Brush your dog every 1-2 weeks. 

The pug is shedding, and there is no way to avoid this. You can keep their coat healthy by brushing once or twice a week with a dog brush or a dog brush when shedding.
- Regular brushing of the pug will also help keep furniture in your home from getting dirty.

### 1.3 Clean your dog's ears with a special solution once a week. 

The pug's small, pretty ears have a shape that easily accumulates dirt. So, you need to clean their ears with a solution specifically designed to clean dog ears. Put the solution in the dog's ear, then wipe the inside with a cotton ball.
- Do not push the cotton ball into the dog's ear canal or use a cotton swab, as this may damage the dog's ears.

### 1.4 Bathe the pug once a month. 

Regardless of whether your dog is dirty or has a bad smell, it is still advisable to bathe the pug once a month. Make sure the bath water level is not too deep for the dog to stand up. Use dog bath soap, available at most pet stores.
- Be sure to rinse your dog well after soaping your dog. Soap can form in the folds, so check carefully to make sure the dog is completely rinsed. Be sure to cover the pug's sensitive eyes when draining the water.

### 1.5 Trim your dog's nails if needed. 

Pug dogs do not sharpen their nails like other active breeds, so it is important to have them trimmed periodically. You can take the pug to a dog grooming service or a veterinarian to manicure them. If you want to trim your dog's nails at home, use a dog-specific nail clipper to avoid cracking. Always cut below the soft center of the nail, called the nail marrow.
- Truncating the nail marrow can be very painful. If you can't see the pulp because the nail is dark or cloudy, it's best to seek out a professional nail clipper.

## 2. Feed the pug

### 2.1 Feed the pug with the right amount of food. 

The pug is very gluttonous, so it is easy to be overweight. You need to closely monitor their diet to ensure proper portion control. Regularly feed your dog one or two meals per day according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
- Remember that the packaged serving size is the maximum amount of pug food per day. If you feed your dog twice a day, split the maximum portion size into two meals.
- Learn to touch the pug's ribs. Ideally, the dog's ribs should be palpable when lightly pressed but not visible. If you have difficulty touching its ribs your pug may be overweight.

### 2.2 Feed the pug with an age-appropriate diet. 

Choose a high-quality dry pellet food that is suitable for your dog's age. If you have a puppy, it needs to be fed with puppy food. If you are an adult, your dog will need to follow the adult dog's diet. If your dog is old, you should give it to old dog food.
- There are also special diets for dogs with health problems, such as low protein and phosphorus for dogs with kidney disease. Talk to your veterinarian about these specific diets to determine the right foods for your dog.

### 2.3 Re-evaluate the pug's diet after a while. 

If you are feeding your dog according to the manufacturer's recommendations and find that your dog is gaining unhealthy weight, talk to your veterinarian. Your doctor can help you adjust food rations or change the type of dog food.

### 2.4 Limit favorite foods. 

Treats are an important part of training and rewarding good behavior. However, you need to include these in your daily diet when feeding your dog. Giving your dog too many treats can cause him to be overweight, which in turn causes or worsens respiratory problems and joint disease.
- Use small pug treats, like training delicacies. Treats intended for larger breeds need to be broken or cut into small pieces.

The Pug is an active breed, but usually only for a short period of time because its flat nose makes it difficult for them to cool down when running, jumping, or playing.

Pug dogs are most healthy when exposed to mild temperatures and weather. In warm regions or during hot weather, make sure you adjust your walks so that your dog doesn't go outside during the hottest part of the day. In cold climates or during cold seasons, consider dressing your dog outdoors.
