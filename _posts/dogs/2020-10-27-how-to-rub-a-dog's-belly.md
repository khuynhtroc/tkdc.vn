> Rubbing your dog's belly sounds like an easy job. Dogs love to be petted, so it seems absurd that such an easy and enjoyable task still needs in-depth explanation and guidance. However, instead of assuming that your dog wants to be rubbed all the time, take the time to learn the dog's language and learn how to rub the dog's belly properly.

## 1. Understand dog language

### 1.1 Observe your dog's posture. 

Before you start rubbing your dog's belly, look at his posture. Drooling and relaxation shows that the dog is very happy and comfortable with rubbing his stomach. [1] On the other hand, you shouldn't rub the dog's stomach if it is stressed out.
- If your dog is asleep, let him sleep quietly and don't wake him up to rub his stomach.

### 1.2 Determine when your dog is obedient. 

Approach the dog first. A dog that turns his back when you approach him shows that he is obedient. A dog's obedience may be accompanied by other acts of submission, such as licking his lips and wagging his tail. The unprofessional will see these actions as an invitation to rub the dog's belly, but not always. [2]
- If your dog is obedient when you approach it, it may be afraid of you and may not want to be rubbed right away.
- To keep your dog comfortable, don't get too close. Call from a distance and let it come to you. When calling, do not reach for the dog to come close to you with your hand. [3]

### 1.3 Understand why your dog's stomach is exposed. 

Your dog may open his stomach as a sign of submission, but this will also show that he believes and wants to play with you. [4] However, you may not always know the true meaning behind the act of exposing your dog's belly. If you are unsure whether your dog is obedient or believing and wants to play with you, consult with your veterinarian so you can tell the difference.
- A dog on his back is putting himself in danger. Therefore, be familiar with the dog so that it can trust and allow you to rub your stomach. [6]

### 2.1 Get your dog's trust. 

If you have established a reliable relationship with your dog, you can rub the dog's belly with ease. However, if your dog does not completely trust you, there are a few ways you can gain trust from your dog. [7]
- Stay calm when approaching your dog. If your dog does not show much interest, taking a calm approach will help him realize that you are not a danger and will trust you more.
- Approaching from one side instead of going front. Going straight ahead can scare your dog. Instead, go to your dog's side, kneel or sit in the dog's gaze. Do not look directly in the eye as the dog may feel threatened. [8]
- If your dog is more comfortable when you approach, sit next to it and gently petting it. Cooing with your dog helps to relieve the tension when you touch it.

### 2.2 Watch if the dog turns his back. 

A dog that refuses to lie on his back indicates that he does not want to rub his stomach. Do not force your dog to lie on his side, as this can cause him anxiety and discomfort. [9] Be respectful if your dog doesn't want to rub his stomach.

### 2.3 Claw the dog's chest. 

Before you rub your stomach, start by stroking the dog's chest. If your dog growls when you stroke your chest, stop immediately. The dog growls, indicating that it does not want to be petted.
- Purring can also be a sign that your dog is very upset. Some problems, like pain or behavioral disorders, can be uncomfortable for the dog. See your vet to see what is causing it. [ten]
- If your dog appears quite pleased when you start petting, continue stroking the dog's chest. Alternatively, you can swipe your finger along the fur to make the dog more comfortable.

### 2.4 Rub your dog's belly. 

If your dog becomes comfortable with you stroking his chest, move your hand to his belly and begin rubbing it. At this point, the dog can be extremely relaxed. You should rub slowly and cover the stomach. Coo with your dog while rubbing his stomach to keep him comfortable.
- Your dog can kick his leg after he has rubbed his stomach. Contrary to popular belief, this is not a sign that the dog is tickling. Kick-off is really just an unconditional reflex or emotional response. [11]
- The unconditional reflex occurs when the nerve connecting the dog's spinal cord is activated under the skin. Your dog will kick his foot automatically because his body sees the nerve activation as an irritant in the skin. If you are rubbing in one place and you see the dog's feet starting to move, stop rubbing in that position and move on to a different part of the belly. [twelfth]
- If your dog is interested in rubbing his stomach but then gets up and walks away, he may not want you to rub it anymore. This is a perfectly normal course of action, so there's no need to worry. [13]
- If your dog stretches when he is rubbed and relaxed after you stop, he may be trying to let you know that this is not the right time to rub his tummy. [14]

> Advice
- Not wanting to be petted is not sure if your dog has a behavior disorder or is sick. Many dogs simply do not like having their stomachs rubbed. If you can't find out why your dog doesn't like to rub his stomach, see your vet to rule out the possibility of the disease or behavior disorder.
