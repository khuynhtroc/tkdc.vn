## 1. Recognize the symptoms of the disease

### 1.1 Track your dog's daily activities. 

Keep a record of when your dog goes to the toilet when symptoms occur when he eats food, etc. This will help shape the symptoms. This is also a useful tool for the doctor to diagnose a dog's disease. 
- If your dog has a mild illness (not eating well during the day, being restless, vomiting once or twice, having diarrhea once), you can take good care of your dog at home and call your veterinarian.

There are symptoms that require urgent medical attention. Never hesitate to call your doctor right away if you experience these symptoms:
- Comatose

- Shortness of breath
- Convulsions continuously for 1 minute
- Urinary retention or not passing urine

### 2.1 Do not feed if your dog is vomiting or has diarrhea. 

In healthy puppies and dogs over 6 months old, you may not be able to feed for up to 24 hours if the initial symptoms are vomiting or diarrhea.

### 2.3 Give your dog bland foods for 1-2 days. 

After you have not fed for 24 hours and your dog is more normal, you can slowly give him a bland feed for 1-2 days. The bland dog diet consists of 1 part protein and 2 servable carbohydrates.
- Commonly used protein sources include cheese from skim milk or chicken (without skin and fat) or boiled meatballs.
- The good starch for dogs is white rice.
- Feed a 5kg dog per day (divided into 4 servings, every 6 hours).

### 2.4 Limit your dog's exercise and jump. 

Make sure your dog gets plenty of rest by limiting his practice and playtime. Get your dog to go outside comfortably, but don't let him run and jump if he feels tired. This is especially important if your dog has leg pain.

### 2.5 Control your dog's stool and urine. 

Pay attention to the number of feces and urine your dog has when sick. If you normally let your dog go to the bathroom outside, then when he or she is sick, take him or her away so you can see his feces and urine.
- Don't punish your dog if he accidentally defecates or vomits indoors. They cannot be controlled because they are sick and may elude you if punished.

### 2.6 Watch closely for your dog's symptoms. 

Make sure you keep an eye on the dog in case the symptoms worsen. Do not leave your dog alone during the day or on weekends. If you have to go somewhere (work for example), check your dog every 2 hours.
- If you can't make the arrangements, call the pet hospital to see if they will take care of your dog at the hospital. Symptoms may worsen quickly, new or more severe symptoms may occur immediately.

### 3.2 Create a comfortable nest for your dog. 

Keep your dog in a nest with a blanket so that it is easy and easy to monitor them. Choose a blanket with your smell to cover your dog to feel comfortable.

### 3.3 Keep the house quiet. 

When your dog is sick, limit noise and lights. Think of the environment as if you were sick. Your dog will thank you for that. Limit visitors to play or noise from vacuum cleaners, children, and television. This will give your dog the rest he wants.
