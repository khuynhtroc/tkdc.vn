## 1. Use ingredients around the house

### 1.1 Spray the baking soda solution around the lawn. 

Prepare a baking soda solution by mixing about one cup of baking soda with 4 liters of water, then spray it around your lawn and poop at least twice a week.
- The baking soda will also keep the grass from getting damaged by your dog's urine.
- Baking soda will neutralize the smell of the urine, both helping to get rid of the unpleasant odor, and also suppressing dog's urine behavior. [first]

### 1.2 Spray vinegar around the lawn. 

Spraying pure vinegar around will create an invisible barrier that prevents both dogs and cats from entering the lawn. When your dog smells the vinegar, he will immediately walk away, but you will need to keep this daily. You can also spray vinegar in areas where your dog's urine is present.
- Vinegar is a natural herbicide that can kill many types of grass. Therefore, you should not spray vinegar on the entire lawn to avoid damaging the grass.
- The vinegar will neutralize the smell of urine, both helping to get rid of the unpleasant odor, while also preventing the dog's behavior of marking territory with urine.

### 1.3 Change the fertilizer. 

Many dogs react strongly to the smell of organic substances. If your dog tends to be attracted to your lawn, try a new fertilizer. Dogs are particularly fond of the smell of blood, fish, and bones, so consider a plant-based fertilizer. [2]

### 1.4 Plant lavender or thorns. 

Dogs do not like the smell of lavender, although it is quite pleasant for humans. [3] In addition, you can also plant spiny plants around your lawn as a natural fence to keep your dog out. [4]

### 1.5 Be careful with other natural ingredients. 

There are many other popular natural remedies that have been shown to be harmful in practice for dogs, especially hot peppers. [5] Also, do not use coffee grounds, mothballs, garlic powder, tobacco, ammonia solution, and cleaning agents to keep your dog out of the lawn. [6]

## 2. Talk to your neighbors

### 2.1 Keep a friendly attitude. 

The first step to getting your dog to stop walking on the grass is to convince his owner to cooperate. Talk and talk about your problems without accusing them or their dogs. Ideally, they will begin to tighter stewardship of the dog once they learn. [7]

### 2.2 Let them know your lawn is unsafe. 

If your neighbor is uncooperative and you are not afraid to lie a little, tell them you just sprayed the herbicide on your lawn and this could be dangerous for your dog. [8]
- This solution is not optimal for many reasons. You will likely get a negative reaction, and lying will discredit you.

### 2.3 Use tougher measures. 

If you know who the dog is, contact them. Don't be too serious, you can invite them over for dinner or something to drink. Instead of accusing it, show your sympathy because they did not know and need to know about the matter. If your neighbor agrees to work it out, then you can move on to something else, continuing to complain may make them frustrated and unwilling to cooperate. [9]
- If you cannot reach an agreement with your neighbor, you can send them a complaint letter and keep a copy to prove to the authority that you tried to resolve the problem. [ten]

### 2.4 Neighborhood complaints. 

Check with local regulations to see if dog owners are responsible for their behavior; most of them will. [11] After that, take a photo of the dog being peeing or defecating on your lawn and call the authorities to make a complaint.
- Usually the rules will be posted on the local website, you can visit there to view the relevant items on the problem. [twelfth]
- Or you can install a security camera to prove that a neighbor's dog is trespassing on your lawn. This is also helpful when you want to lodge a complaint with the authorities if your neighbor is engaging in aggressive behavior. [13]

## 3. Take stronger measures

### 3.1 Spray a dog repellent. 

Dog repellents are usually spray or powder and can be purchased from pet stores or gardening stores. These products contain a variety of scents that help repel dogs and are mostly made from natural ingredients.
- Some dog repellents have an unpleasant odor that your dog does not like, others have a scent of predator urine that makes the dog afraid to approach. [14]

### 3.2 Installing induction watering hose. 

Induction sprinklers not only water the lawn but can also scare away unwanted guests, such as dogs, cats and raccoons. Install the device around lawn or other areas where dogs are prone to defecation. When a dog passes by, the sensor will activate the sprinkler, which will startle the dog and leave. [15]

### 3.3 Make a fence. 

Fences are very useful in preventing animals from entering the lawn. Dogs tend to defecate in easy spots so they will prefer unfenced turf and bypass fenced areas. Remember to close the fence door and regularly check around to see if the dog is stubbornly digging a hole to get through.
- If you already have a fence, check to see if there are holes that need fixing. You can also install an electric fence, however this solution is quite extreme.

### 3.4 Use an ultrasonic dog repellent. 

This is also a sensor, you can attach it to a roof, tree, or fence. When the dog approaches, the sensor will activate and the device will emit sound waves and ultrasonic waves that make the dog uncomfortable.
- The effectiveness of this device is not clearly proven, until there is more convincing evidence you should only choose this method when there is no other way. [16]
