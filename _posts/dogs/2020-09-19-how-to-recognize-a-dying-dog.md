## How To Recognize A Dying Dog?

## Part 1: Know if your dog is dying

![Recognize a Dying Dog Step 1]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-recognize-a-dying-dog/v4-728px-Recognize-a-Dying-Dog-Step-1.jpg.webp)

### 1. Pay attention to respiratory symptoms. 

If your dog is about to die in a few days or hours, you will notice that your dog is breathing shallowly and punctually. The dog's normal breathing rate is about 22 beats / min, but will drop to 10 beats / min if he is about to die.
- Just before dying, your dog will often breathe deeply, and like a balloon, you can feel the dog's body collapse with the elasticity of his lungs.
- Your dog's heart rate will also weaken and decrease from the normal range of 100-130 beats / min to 60-80 / min.
- During the final hours of life, the dog will begin to breathe shallow and become unable to move. Most of the time, the dog is only in a dark or hidden corner of the house.

### 2. Recognize digestive signs. 

If the dog is dying, the dog will become markedly anorexia. Dogs are hardly interested in food or water. As death approaches, the dog's organs such as the liver and kidneys weaken and inhibit digestive function.
- You may find that the dog's mouth is dry and dehydrated because he is dehydrated.
- You may also see that your dog is vomiting yellow or green saliva or acid or bile instead of food. This is often caused by anorexia.

### 3. Pay attention to muscle activity. 

If the dog is dying, the dog will often have jerks or unintentional muscle spasms due to the loss of glucose. Your dog will also lose response to pain and other reflexes.
- When the dog tries to stand or walk, you will find that the dog's feet lose coordination and the dog tends to wobble or lose its ability to walk. Your dog will also become lethargic or lose consciousness before dying.

### 4. Pay attention to your dog's toilet habits. 

Another warning sign of a dying dog is loss of bladder and anal sphincter control. When dying, dogs tend to defecate and urinate uncontrollably even in highly disciplined and trained dogs.
- Dogs often urinate uncontrollably and urinate sparingly.
- A dying dog is also more likely to experience diarrhea, sometimes accompanied by a foul odor and blood.
- Dogs tend to urinate and defecate for the last time before dying because they have lost complete muscle control.

### 5. Pay attention to skin condition. 

Dog skin will become dry and will usually not return to its original position after being pinched due to dehydration. Mucous membranes such as gums and lips will also become pale and will not return to their original pink color if you press on them in a long time (normal gums only take 1 second to revert to their original color).

## Part 2: Know if your dog is getting old

![Recognize a Dying Dog Step 6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-recognize-a-dying-dog/v4-728px-Recognize-a-Dying-Dog-Step-6.jpg.webp)

### 1. Pay attention to the dog's speed. 

Your dog will move more and more slowly but can still eat, drink, walk, stand and react when you call to show that the dog is just getting old. Outside of age, dogs do not suffer from special problems.
- Dogs can still do favorite things like walking around, being petted, playing or socializing with other dogs, although the frequency and intensity is much reduced.

### 2. Pay attention to how much food your dog can eat. 

A sign of aging is when the dog starts to eat less but steadily. Like humans, dogs often burn fewer calories and do not need to overeat as they age. This happens as a matter of course in life and not an alarming problem.

### 3. Pay attention to how much time your dog sleeps. 

Older dogs usually sleep more, but can still get up, walk around, and eat. Sleeping without being able to walk and eating shows that the dog is sick. In case of a lot of sleep but still able to eat normally is only a sign of age.

You can provide your dog with a comfortable life by:
- Keep your dog in a warm, airy room

### 2. Think carefully before killing your dog. 

If you are wondering whether you should be safe for your dog or not, you should put the dog's interests first. You should give up all your questions, emotions, and personalities. Do not prolong your dog's life for personal gain. By accepting the virtue and responsibility of the owner, you should give the dog a humane and painless death. Ask yourself questions like: [1]
- Is treatment no longer going to help dogs?
- Are dogs in pain and suffering that painkillers can't help?
- Is the dog suffering from severe trauma, causing severe pain and never recovering, such as amputation, severe head injury, or serious bleeding?
- Will terminal illness impair a dog's quality of life and prevent the dog from eating, drinking, moving or going to the toilet on its own?
- Does the dog have an inoperable birth defect that affects his quality of life?
- Can dogs suffer from infectious diseases such as rabies and can be a threat to people and other dogs?
- Will the dog no longer be able to do the things he loves, even with treatment?
