## 1. Teach your dog to lie down at the command

### 1.1 Teach the command "to lie" before teaching to fake death. 

The fake death game includes lying down. Before you can learn this game, your dog should be used to the command to lie down. [first]

![Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-2]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-play-dead-on-commands/v4-728px-Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-2-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.2 Choose a comfortable place to train your dog. 

Ideally, the place should be quiet so that your dog won't distract him easily. [2]

### 1.3 Command your dog to sit. 

If your dog doesn't know this command, teach him by holding a treat and holding it up. When the dog looks up at the treat, push the dog's rump with his hand until he sits down, at the same time shout "sit" in a firm voice. [3]
- Once the dog is seated, give the treat to the dog instead of letting it jump. Strictly say "no" if it jumps up. [4]
- Practice this command several times a day, until the dog can sit without you pushing his ass down. Each training session should last about 10-15 minutes. [5]
- Continue to give your dog a treat as an incentive every time he listens to sit commands.

### 1.4 Stand in front of the dog when telling him to sit. 

Hold the treat in front of the dog's nose, but do not feed it. Slowly lower the treat to the ground while holding it in front of the dog's nose. [6]
- Say "lie" as you move the treat to the ground so that your dog associates the word "lying" with the act of lying down. [7]
- The dog should lie down when you lower the treat to the ground. [8]
- If your dog bounces, keep practicing until it lies down every time you put the treat on the ground. [9]
- Give the dog a treat for lying down without getting up immediately. [ten]

### 1.5 Instruct your dog to lie down without a reward. 

Raise your hand in front of the dog's nose and pretend you are holding a treat. [11]
- Move your hand as if you were holding a treat to lure it down. [twelfth]
- As above, reward your dog for lying down completely without getting up immediately. [13]

![Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-play-dead-on-commands/v4-728px-Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-6-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.6 Continue practicing until your dog learns to lie down at the command. 

You need to train your dog to do this command several times a day, for at least a few days. [14]
- Each training session should last about 10-15 minutes.
- If you want to challenge the dog, you can gradually decrease the visual cue until it responds with the command "lie". [15]

## 2. Teach your dog to stay still

![Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-play-dead-on-commands/v4-728px-Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-7-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Teach your dog to stay still before teaching how to fake death. 

If your dog doesn't know how to stay still, it will be difficult to teach him how to play dead. Make sure the dog is comfortable holding a certain position before you teach him the trick. [16]

![Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-play-dead-on-commands/v4-728px-Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-8-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Choose a comfortable place to train your dog. 

Places like a dog's bed or a comfortable rug are good options. You can also choose an outdoor lawn for dog training.[17]

![Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-play-dead-on-commands/v4-728px-Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-9.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Command your dog to do the pose you want. 

Teaching your dog to stay in the "sitting" or "standing" position will help him get ready to learn from death. [18]

![Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-play-dead-on-commands/v4-728px-Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-10.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 Stand in front of the dog for 1-2 seconds. 

If it starts to approach you before the time expires, you must start over. When your dog can hold it for 1-2 seconds, reward it. [19]
- After receiving the reward, the dog is allowed to approach you because it has successfully executed a command to hold it in place.

![Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-play-dead-on-commands/v4-728px-Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-11.jpg.webp)

### 2.5 Increase the amount of time you spend in front of the dog. 

Stand a little longer each time until it can stay in place for at least 10 seconds. [20]
- Each 1-2 second increment will help your dog stay still longer.
- Reward the dog each time he stays there for a few seconds.

![Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-play-dead-on-commands/v4-728px-Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-12.jpg.webp)

### 2.6 Use voice tags and video cues. 

When your dog is in the position where you want it to stay, shout “still” and raise your hand as a stop signal. [21]
- It can take your dog a few days to associate these commands with rest, so be patient with it.
- Give your dog a treat every time it successfully performs and obeys the command.

![Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-play-dead-on-commands/v4-728px-Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-13.jpg.webp)

### 2.7 Increase the distance between you and the dog. 

Although you can train your dog to stay still when he cannot see you, [22] it is important to see you when you teach him how to play dead.
- You can stand further away, but still let the dog see you, like leaning to the left or right.

## 3. Teach your dog to fake death

![Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-play-dead-on-commands/v4-728px-Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-14.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Command your dog to lie down while sitting or standing. 

Your dog may prefer to lie on one side over the other, so be aware of which side he prefers to lie on. [23]
- Command your dog to sit or stand, and then get him to lie down.
- As you practice this exercise, make sure your dog is lying on his side on the floor; Perhaps it prefers to do so.

![Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-play-dead-on-commands/v4-728px-Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-15.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Instruct your dog to lie down on his side. 

Don't use a voice tag for this; You need to use your hands, rewards, and signaling tools (clickers). Remember that you may need to teach your dog how to do this, so be patient when teaching him how to follow your instructions.
- You can rest your dog on his side by gently pushing it down with both hands. Once your dog is lying down, reward him with encouragement (eg, complimenting, rubbing his stomach, giving him a treat). [24]
- You can also use food to lure your dog to lie down. Hold the treat in front of the dog's nose. Then move the treat to its shoulder (left shoulder if it is on right side, and right shoulder if it is on left side). When the dog turns to get a reward, it will slowly lie down on its side. Use clickers and other incentives every time your dog lies down to let him know he is doing it right. [25]

![Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-play-dead-on-commands/v4-728px-Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-16.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Train your dog to lie down from a sitting or standing position. 

The smoother your dog moves from one position to another, the closer your dog will be to learn the game of fake death.
- Use a clicker and reward your dog every time he moves from a standing or sitting position to a lying position, as well as when he moves from normal to lying on his side. [26]

![Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-play-dead-on-commands/v4-728px-Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-17.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Shout commands to teach dogs to fake death. 

You will know that your dog is ready to follow a command if he automatically lies on his side when he sees a reward or when you lure him with food. [27]
- You can use any voice tag you like. The most commonly used voice command in this game is "Pằng!".
- Be consistent in using voice commands. You don't want to confuse your dog by using different verbal cues for the same request. [28]

![Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-play-dead-on-commands/v4-728px-Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-18.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Use verbal cue more often instead of using food to seduce. 

At this stage, your goal is to teach your dog how to fake death as a reaction to a voice rather than luring it with food. [29]
- It may take a while for your dog to learn to respond without luring with food, so be patient with it.

![Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-play-dead-on-commands/v4-728px-Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-19.jpg.webp)

### 3.6 Use visual cues (use hands to signal). 

A common visual signal in this game is the shape of a gun. Your dog won't immediately understand the visual cue, so include the voice tag you have chosen for this game. [30]
- There are several ways to signal a gun: the thumb and index finger of one hand, the thumb and index and middle fingers of one hand, or the thumb and index finger of the hands pressed together. With the last choice, the fingers left should be intertwined.
- Signaling images at the same time chanting voice commands. [thirty first]
- Alternatively, you can use the visual cue after the voice command. If you want to try this, use the visual cue before the dog does what you want. If the dog obeys the cue before you can use the cue and continues to do so after repeated attempts, you can either stop using the visual cue or signal it at the same time as the voice command. [32]
- At the same time shout out a voice command and signal a video until your dog shows he can fake death by both commands at the same time.

![Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-play-dead-on-commands/v4-728px-Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-20.jpg.webp)

### 3.7 Use only visual cue. 

Finally, you may want to teach your dog to fake a death with just visual cue. Regardless of what the signal means, your dog may still need more time to respond without a voice command or with food. [33]
- Gradually use only visual cues while reducing voice commands and other commands.
- Reward your dog every time he does a game with only a visual cue.

![Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-21]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-play-dead-on-commands/v4-728px-Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-21.jpg.webp)

### 3.8 Practice this game in many different locations. 

Just because your dog is faking his death in one place doesn't mean it can do it automatically in other locations or situations. Practicing the trick in different places or in front of different people will help your dog to master it. [34]
- Different locations may include different rooms in the house, a dog park, or in front of a crowd. [35]

![Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-22]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-play-dead-on-commands/v4-728px-Teach-Your-Dog-to-Play-Dead-on-Command-Step-22.jpg.webp)

### 3.9 Be patient with the dog until it has mastered the game. 

Your dog can learn in a few days or it can take up to several weeks. No matter how fast or slow you learn, you will be greatly rewarded for its progress. [36]

> Advice
- Set aside 5-15 minutes a day to exercise. Pretending to die is a more difficult task than others, so you'll need to practice with your dog for at least a few minutes a day until he learns each step. [37]
- This game requires your dog to switch positions and respond to commands, so teach only one new step at a time. [38]
- Do not scold the dog. This action not only makes your dog angry and mad at you, but also discourages him from learning.
- Make sure your dog enjoys the game. If it is distracting, frustrating, or depressed, take a break or postpone it for the next day.
- The best way to show your dog that he did it wrong is to keep the treat. Remember to help and teach him how to do it right if he makes a mistake.

> Warning
- Avoid giving your dog treats that are toxic to it, such as dark chocolate. If you are unsure about a dog reward, you can go to a pet store and ask about a safe reward for your dog.
- Don't teach your dog to play deadly games if your dog has arthritis or other joint problems. It will be very difficult and painful to switch from one position to another if the joints are in pain. [39]
