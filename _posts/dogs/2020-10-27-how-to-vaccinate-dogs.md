## 1. Prepare to vaccinate dogs

### 1.1 Take the dog to the vet. 

You need to get your dog checked for a checkup before getting vaccinated. A veterinarian will determine if the dog is healthy enough for home vaccination. If the dog is sick or has a weakened immune system, the vaccination will be ineffective or make the dog sick.
- Vaccination can help your dog fight many diseases, but you should not give rabies vaccination yourself. Only a veterinarian is able to vaccinate dogs against rabies. [first]

### 1.2 Recognize reactions to vaccines. 

Dogs react very rarely to vaccines, but you should still be on the lookout for possible reactions. Your dog may have swelling at the injection site, mild fever, weakness or loss of appetite, sneezing or coughing. [2] One of the most serious reactions is anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical treatment. If your dog is having trouble breathing, has a slow heartbeat, or has low blood pressure, you should seek immediate veterinary medical attention. [3] If your dog has a low heart rate or low blood pressure, the dog may become abnormally sleepy, depressed, lethargic, and eventually fainting within 20-30 minutes.
- Most animal vaccines are administered only under the skin to relieve the pain and possible reactions.
- If your dog has ever responded to a vaccine, even if the reaction is minor, you should not try to get any home vaccines to prevent a more serious reaction.

### 1.3 Have a basic understanding of vaccines. 

A vaccine works by simulating viruses or bacteria that cause infections by stimulating the immune system to produce cells against viruses or bacteria. [4] Vaccines help prepare the immune system for viruses or bacteria in the future. So when a dog is vaccinated against a particular virus or bacteria, his immune system remembers how to fight the infection and how to build cells against that virus or bacteria. . [5]
- In fact, with the exception of some mild reactions (mild rash or fever), the vaccine only mimics viruses or bacteria and does not infect the dog at all.

### 1.4 Get vaccinated according to the schedule. 

For many vaccines, you can get the first 2 shots 3-4 weeks apart to keep your immune system working. Thereafter, every 2-3 years, you can give your dog a booster so that the prevention is constantly updated.
- Each vaccine has its own timing of vaccination, so you should consult with your veterinarian to determine when to vaccinate your dog. [6]

## 2. Get vaccinated for dogs

### 2.1 Prepare for an injection. 

Check that the vaccine is properly transported and stored at the temperature on the label. You may have to mix the vaccines. If so, you will need to combine the 2 vaccines according to the directions on the label. After reconstitution, you will draw all the solution into the syringe and remove air bubbles by gently patting the surface of the syringe. You should point the needle upwards. [7]
- Most vaccines need to be stored at room temperature in the refrigerator.

### 2.2 Prepare your dog. 

Make sure you wash your dog well and remove any dirt from the skin around the neck. Dog coat must be dry before vaccination. You will pull up the skin on the back of the dog's nape, creating an empty bag under the skin to inject the vaccine. [8]
- Unlike human injections, you do not need to wipe the injection site clean with alcohol before giving a dog vaccination.

### 2.3 Vaccination. 

Place the syringe across the dog's back so that the bevel of the needle (the flat part of the needle) is along the pinched skin. Gently insert the needle into the skin, while pulling the syringe back together. Slowly push down on the syringe to inject the vaccine into the dog's body. [9]
- If you see bleeding from the needle, you should inject it elsewhere. The bleeding from the needle indicates that you have punctured a blood vessel. You cannot inject the vaccine into a blood vessel.

### 2.4 Pull out the needle. 

After you remove the needle, press on the injection site for about 30 seconds to stop bleeding. Put the needle and syringe in a suitable trash can or glass jar for disposal at the veterinary clinic. [ten]
- Do not dispose of uncovered needles in the trash to avoid harming environmental workers in the garbage disposal process.

> Advice
- If you are not confident about vaccinating your dog, you can take your dog for vaccination at the vet.
- If you feel the need to practice before giving a real vaccination to your dog, you can put a sock in an empty water bottle, and then wrap the socks in a cluster that looks like a "dog paw" when giving the shot. You should practice giving injections until you are comfortable with one-handed injection. Practice using the syringe and grabbing them all at the same time to get used to both movements before giving the dog the actual injection.
- You have to be calm and collected to help your dog relax while getting the vaccine.
- After the injection, reward your dog for being obedient. This way your dog will not be afraid of each injection.

> Warning
- Only vaccines recommended by your veterinarian should be given.
- Do not inject the vaccine into a vein.
- Do not get vaccinated if the dog is sick or immunocompromised. Also, dogs with diarrhea or vomiting are not vaccinated.
- Be sure to sterilize all vaccination equipment and follow proper sterilization procedures. Absolutely do not use unpasteurized tools to vaccinate dogs.
- Buy vaccines from the licensed establishment to make sure they are stored correctly.
