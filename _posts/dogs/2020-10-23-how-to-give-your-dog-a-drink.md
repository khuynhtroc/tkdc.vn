> Healthy dogs are usually in control of their water intake, even though this is not necessarily true for puppies and older dogs. Unless there are serious signs of health, your dog will most likely drink enough water after a few changes to his diet and bowl layout.

## 1. Dealing with dehydration

### 1.1  Watch for signs of dehydration. 

Most healthy dogs have fairly good control over their water intake. Don't worry without checking for signs of health problems or dehydration in your dog:
- Gently pinch the skin on the dog's nape or between the shoulder blades, then let go of the hand. If the skin does not immediately return to its original position, it is possible that your dog is dehydrated.
- Press your finger lightly against the dog's gums until the pressure fades away, then lift your finger. If the gum you press does not quickly return to its original color, your dog may be dehydrated. [first]
- Other signs that may appear when a dog is dehydrated are lethargy, loss of appetite, changes in urine output, and color of urine. If only these signs are present, the condition is not serious unless they are very severe or last more than a day.

### 1.2 Recognize your risk factors. 

Stages of a dog's life and health problems can increase the frequency and severity of dehydration. You should pay special attention to the following situations:
- Like humans, dogs can become dehydrated in hot weather. Make sure your dog drinks enough water in hot weather.
- Vomiting, diarrhea, gasping for breath, or heavy drooling can all cause dehydration if the dog doesn't drink more water to make up for the lost water.
- Likewise, kidney disease and other chronic illnesses can cause dehydration.
- If your dog is diabetic, pregnant, breastfeeding, very young, or very old, you should take your dog to the veterinarian at the first sign of dehydration.

### 1.3 Take the dog to the vet. 

If your dog exhibits any of the above symptoms and refuses to drink water, take the dog to the vet as soon as possible. Your doctor may administer ,isotonic saline intravenously or inject the fluid under the skin to quickly rehydrate your dog.
- The vet will also check for health problems in the dog that can lead to dehydration, such as kidney disease. After making a diagnosis, your doctor can prescribe a special medication or diet for your dog.

### 1.4 Give your dog a rehydration solution. 

If your dog has symptoms of dehydration but can't get it to the doctor right away, dilute the Pedialyte rehydration solution with the same amount of water and give him 1 cup (240 mL) every hour. [2] Rehydration solutions are available in pharmacies.
- Do not add any other ingredients, or you could harm your dog further.
- Although other rehydration solutions are easy to buy, you should still consult your veterinarian before use, if possible.

### 1.5 Add flavors and electrolytes to the water. 

If you can't find the Pedialyte solution, pour some low-salt chicken broth or diluted carrot juice into the water. This will help replenish the electrolytes lost due to dehydration and add flavor to the dog to appeal to the sick dog.

### 1.6 Use a syringe if needed. 

If your sick dog definitely refuses to drink, find a syringe with no needles attached to it and pump it into the dog's mouth. Spray the dog's cheek with water instead of pumping it directly into his throat to avoid choking on him.

## 2. Everyday tactics

### 2.1 Get your dog to exercise. 

Dogs need daily exercise like brisk walking or playing in the park or yard. If your dog is not exercising properly, it may not become dehydrated from gasping for breath and will not be thirsty like other healthy, active dogs.
- When taking your dog for a long walk, bring water with you and drink it every 10 minutes. This will practice the dog the habit of drinking water regularly while at home.
- You should only exercise your dog when you are healthy. For older or sick dogs, ask your vet about other options.

### 2.2 Feed your dog wet food. 

Wet food is readily available and is usually indicated on the food box with the words "% moisture content". You can replace all dry dog ​​food with wet food, be sure to check the label or ask your vet about the right amount of food for your dog.
- You can also choose to soak dry food in a bowl of water for 30-60 minutes before feeding your dog.

### 2.3 Give the dog the right meal. 

You should only feed your dog one or two meals a day, according to your veterinarian's recommendations or the instructions on the food packaging. If eaten continuously, some dogs will mistake the feeling of thirst for hunger.

### 2.4 Allow your dog to pee out when needed. 

If your dog is stuck indoors for 8 hours, he or she will probably avoid drinking water knowing that this will fill up the bladder and cause discomfort. You need to let your dog go out to pee every few hours or train your dog to use sanitary pads.

## 3. Set up a plate of water

### 3.1 Always have water available for your dog to drink. 

If your house has multiple floors, put a bowl of water on each floor that your dog can access. If your dog is often in the yard or locked in a room, put an extra bowl of water in those areas.
- Try to place the "watering station" in a fixed place so your dog knows where to drink.
- Dogs that are chained outdoors may become entangled or leashed and the water bowl cannot be accessed. [3] If there is no other way to replace the dog's leash, clear all obstructions and place the water bowl next to the dog chain. The water bowl can fall over the chain or chain, so check it regularly and rehydrate when necessary.

### 3.2 Change the water regularly. 

Every day, you should empty the bowl, wash off any dirt before pouring new water and using a paper towel to wipe the bowl. Change the water whenever you notice dog hair or dirt in the bowl or when the bowl is low. In hot weather, you may need to check the bowl every few hours.
- Rinse well and dry the water bowl at least once a week. Wash more often if the water bowl is dirty.

### 3.3 Consider using an automatic water bottle for dogs and cats. 

These can be more appealing to dogs who like running water or puppies that are not used to drinking water in a bowl. A water bottle also makes it easier for a dog with low vision to find.

### 3.4 Put ice cubes in the water on hot days. 

Many dogs love to drink cold water. Put some ice cubes in the bowl of water and let the dog see. Maybe your dog will be curious to come and examine the bowl of water.

### 3.5 Make the water bowl more lively. 

If you don't want to buy an automatic drink bottle, try shaking the water bowl or waving the toy over the bowl. A few blueberries or other small treats placed in a bowl of water may also encourage your dog to drink when he gets out of the water.
- If your dog remains indifferent, try again after replacing the dog's water bowl with a regular cup or bowl of a different shape and color.

> Advice
- Do not place the dog's water bowl in the sun. Most dogs do not like to drink warm water.

> Warning
- If your dog ends up drinking after you've put in so much effort to comfort it, let it drink. Excessive attention can distract the dog from the water bowl.
- Do not let your dog drink water in the bathroom; that could be the source of the bacteria. [4]
