Luckily the dog gets used to its name very quickly and easily, regardless of whether it is the first name or the name has been changed. Following these basic instructions, your dog will quickly recognize and respond when you call them a new name in just a few days.

## 1. Choose a name

### 1.1 Be sure to change the dog's name again. 

In the beginning, dogs can be confused, but within a short time they will get used to their new name. [1] Additionally, many experts recommend renaming dogs known or suspected to have been tortured or in poor environments. Because such trauma can make them remember their old names with punishment, torture and fear. In these cases, you should not only change the dog's name, but also help him recover and forget the damage it has suffered. [2]
- There is nothing wrong with changing a dog's name, unless its former owner specifically told you not to.

### 1.2 To name. 

Once you've decided to change your dog's name, the next step will be deciding what the new name will be. Here are a few basic guidelines:
- If you know the dog's old name, consider choosing a similar one to make it easier for the dog to get used to his new name. For example, a name that rhymes or sounds the same.
- Usually, a short name will be used by dogs more quickly, a 1 to 2 syllable name like Bear, Ruby, Billy, etc .. [3]
- It is recommended to use 'strong' consonants or vowels, such as 'k,' 'd,' and 't'. Because names like these will help your dog hear better and avoid using soft consonants, like 'f,', 's', or 'm.' For example, names like Ki, Deedee (Di-di), or Tommy are names that most dogs will recognize and respond to more quickly than names like Mi-mi or Sunny. [4]
- Avoid using names that sound like common dog words like "no", "sit", "stay", "come here". Names like these make it difficult for dogs to determine exactly what you want them to do. [5]
- Avoid naming names that sound the same as family members' names or the names of other pets. This can also confuse the dog and slow down its adaptation to a new name. [6]
- Avoid using a temporary alias until you choose an official name, being called by too many different names can confuse your dog and make it more difficult to change the name.

### 1.3 Tell everyone in the house about the new name. 

Before you begin retraining your dog, make sure everyone knows about the change and agree on the new one. Because it will be difficult for the dog to be called by many different names. Letting people know about the new name will make the renaming process easier.

## 2. Teach your dog a new name

### .first Use of food. Teaching a dog a new name is like teaching it other things. Your dog should learn to get used to a new name with food just as you would when you were teaching him voice commands. Put everyone in the house some food in a bag, have them call the dog by a new name from time to time and give it food.
Always call your dog's name in a cheerful voice. Don't call out their names in an angry tone or as if you were blaming them. The most important thing is that the dog must learn to get acquainted with his new name in the positivity, not punishment and unhappiness. Make sure everyone in the house knows this.

### .2 Get the dog to a place where you can get its attention. It could be in your yard or in a quiet place outside, where there is no other dog distracting. Chain it up or not.

### .3 Start by calling out your dog's new name in a cheerful and excited voice. Then give him food along with compliments. Repeat this lesson several times for about 5 minutes. The dog will quickly understand when being called by a new name means that it must pay attention to the caller. [7]
This lesson should only be taught in a short period of time as dogs often don't focus on something for a long time and get bored very quickly.
Try to do this lesson several times a day. When you do this, call out the dog's name every time you talk to it. Occasionally call it by name when it doesn't pay attention to you, but don't overdo it. If your dog responds, reward him with food and give him lots of praise.

### .4 Call the dog's name when it is not focused on you. After repeatedly calling out his name and the dog responds, wait until it no longer looks at you, then call out its name. Repeat this in a cheerful and excited voice. [8]
If the dog is chained and does not turn around when you call, gently pull the dog towards you while continuing to call its name, praise, and feed it. This helps your pet remember his name and good memories. [9]

### .5 Gradually stop giving the dog food. Once the dog has fully responded to being called, it is time to slowly stop giving food. Start by showing it the other way each time it responds when you call its new name. Then gradually reduce the food until it stops completely.

### .6 Persistence. It will take a while for the dog to get used to the new name. If you call out his name often with a cheerful tone, and always enjoy food and praise, he will quickly get used to the new name and respond to you every time you call!
Never use the old dog's name. Even if you just want it to focus on you or keep it from slipping off the chain, this only confuses it. If you are still in contact with the dog's former owner (for example, if you receive it from an acquaintance), remind them to call out the dog's new name when you visit.
