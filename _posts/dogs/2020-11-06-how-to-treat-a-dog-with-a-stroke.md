The signs of a dog stroke can be very frightening, but be aware that it does not usually affect as much as it does in humans. You should learn to recognize the signs of your dog having a stroke so that you can handle it properly if this happens to your dog. If you suspect your dog has had a stroke, seek the help of a veterinarian immediately and carefully follow all the instructions during treatment.

## 1. Recognize your dog has had a stroke

### 1.1 Watch for the symptoms of a stroke in your dog. 

Dog strokes often occur when blood vessels in the brain burst (hemorrhagic stroke) or become blocked (ischemic stroke). Dog stroke symptoms can come on quite suddenly and can also differ from typical human stroke signs. Your dog may have had a stroke if: [1]
- Walk around for no apparent reason.
- Head tilted to one side.
- Turns in the wrong direction when called.
- Difficulty keeping balance, difficulty standing or walking.
- Leaden.
- Sudden incontinence.
- Signs of vision loss.
- Suddenly fell down.
- You may also notice that the dog's eyes are moving quickly from side to side, as if looking at a moving object (eyeball shaking). Stroke is the only possible cause of fibrillation of the eyeball, but it's a good idea to have your veterinarian evaluate it.

### 1.2 Look at your dog's risk factors for stroke. 

You can help your veterinarian diagnose stroke and pinpoint the cause more quickly by telling your doctor what risk factors your dog has that could cause stroke. The risk of stroke is higher in older dogs and dogs with a history of: [2]
- Head injury or injury
- Heart disease
- Diabetes
- Kidney disease
- Endocrine disorders, such as thyroid disease or Cushing's disease.
- Brain tumors
- Exposure to certain toxins
- There are several types of parasites or diseases caused by ticks, such as Rocky Mountain scarlet fever

### 1.3 Take your dog to the vet. 

If you suspect your dog has had a stroke, take your dog to the veterinarian right away and tell the doctor your dog's symptoms and history. In addition to examining and observing the dog's behavior, the doctor may use imaging tests such as MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), CT scan (computed tomography), or x-rays to confirm or rule out stroke.
- Your doctor may also perform other tests, such as lumbar spinal puncture, to check for other conditions with similar symptoms.
- Your veterinarian will check for bleeding, thrombosis, inflammation or a tumor in the brain.
- Treat any stroke symptoms like an emergency. Early medical intervention can help give your dog the best possible results.

## 2. Seek medical attention for your dog

### 2.1 Start treating the underlying cause of the stroke. 

If the test shows your dog has had a stroke, your doctor will talk to you about the causes of this condition. There is no specific treatment for stroke except to treat the cause. [3]
- Ischemic stroke is associated with conditions such as diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, heart or kidney disease, and high blood pressure. Cerebral hemorrhagic stroke often results from thrombosis, high blood pressure, rat poison poisoning, and weakened blood vessels.
- Other causes of stroke include brain tumors and head injuries. Once you've diagnosed your stroke and identified the cause, your doctor can recommend a treatment regimen.

### 2.2 Follow your veterinarian's home care instructions. 

Once diagnosed by a doctor, most dog strokes can be treated at home. Your doctor can prescribe medications and teach you how to care for your dog and monitor its condition. Your dog may become disoriented and have difficulty walking. The routine for home dog care usually includes:
- Make sure your dog has a comfortable bed.
- Take your dog outside to go to the bathroom.
- Keep food and water near the bed within easy reach of the dog.
- Give your dog medication prescribed by your doctor.
- You can also give your dog a daily massage to increase his ability to move. Use the palm of your hand to rub all over the dog's body.

### 2.3 Keep your dog in hospital for treatment if recommended by your veterinarian. 

In the case of a severe or traumatic stroke, the doctor may want to keep the dog for monitoring and treatment. If the cause of the stroke is trauma, the first step will be to reduce swelling in the brain and rehydrate your dog. Your dog will receive intravenous fluids to stay hydrated.
- Medicines like Amlodipine can be used to control high blood pressure if the stroke is caused by high blood pressure.
- Other medications may also be used, for example NSAID anti-inflammatory drugs if swelling is evident, antibiotics if infection, sedatives to treat ataxia and disorientation, antiemetics to treat vomiting and stomach pain, and anticonvulsants to control seizures.
- The dog will be placed in a comfortable position with the head lower than the body during treatment. This posture will help stimulate proper blood circulation.

### 2.4 Monitor your dog continuously throughout the recovery period. 

The home-care routine includes constant monitoring during recovery. You may need to mobilize more help from others, such as having your neighbors watch over you while you are away. You can also hire a dog care service when you are not at home.
- Take advantage of your lunch break and run home to check on your dog, or consider working from home if you can. Also ask if you can bring your dog to work.

### 2.5 Give your dog medicine prescribed by your veterinarian. 

The doctor can prescribe medication to help your dog recover from a stroke and prevent further strokes. Dogs with symptoms of ataxia and disorientation may be given a sedative. Other medications for treatment include:
- Antiemetics to treat vomiting.
- Anti-inflammatory drugs to help reduce swelling.
- Antibiotics to treat infections.
- Anticonvulsants to control seizures and prevent future strokes.
- Antiplatelet agents such as Plavix and anticoagulants are long-term therapy to prevent blood clots.
- Drugs that increase the delivery of oxygen in the blood to the brain, such as propentofylline (Vivitonin).

### .6 Talk to your doctor about your dog's prognosis. 

How quickly or slowly your dog recovers depends on many factors, including the severity of the stroke and other underlying medical conditions. A severe stroke can cause permanent disability. However, with the right treatment, you can improve your dog's quality of life as much as possible and help him correct problems such as poor balance.
- Your veterinarian may recommend physical therapy to help your dog regain function and learn to compensate for permanent complications.

> Advice
- Stroke symptoms can resemble other medical conditions, such as vestibular disorder in older dogs. Whatever the cause, these symptoms should always be evaluated by the veterinarian as soon as possible. [4]
