## 1. Take your dog's measurements

### 1.1 Prepare the necessary things. 

Because you need to measure your dog's bust and length, be sure to have a tape measure, pencil, and note pad. It is easier to take your measurements when you ask someone to hold the dog.
- You can reward your dog with food to encourage it to stay still.

### 1.2 Determine where to measure your dog's bust. 

Help your dog stand up to measure his chest circumference (bust measurement). Measure the widest part of the chest just behind the dog's elbow.
- Have a friend hold the food right above the dog's nose. Here's a way to lure your dog to stand as tall as possible.

### 1.3 Measure your dog's bust. 

Place one end of the measuring tape on the dog's spine just behind the shoulder. Pull the other end of the reel downwards to the bottom of the chest. Pull the measuring tape once, then bring it upwards to the correct position to start the measurement. Make sure that the tape measure fits snugly, but not tightly, against the dog's skin. [first]
- The widest part of the chest is located just behind the fore leg and behind the elbow. This part is like the elbow resting on one's desk.

### 1.4 Measure measurements. 

After using the tape measure around your dog's chest, make a note of your measurements. This is the measurement that is visible when the ends of the tape measure touch.

### 1.5 Determine where to measure your dog's length. 

Help your dog stay upright to measure his body length from the back of the neck to the head of the tail.
- You may need to have a dog feeder to encourage it to stay upright.

### 1.6 Measure the dog's length. 

Place one end of the tape measure at the back of your neck close to the shoulder (nape). Extend the other end along the length of the spine to the head of the tail. [2]
- If you do not know the position above, you need to figure out where the dog's collar will be and measure from there to the head of the tail. This will be the length of the shirt you want to buy.

### 1.7 Record your measurements. 

After you've stretched the tape measure along the dog's spine, take note of the number you see on the tape measure that touches the head of the tail. This is the dog's length measurement.

## 2. Choose the right shirt size

### 2.1 Choose the right material. 

Know why you should buy a shirt: it helps your dog feel warm, dry, or dressed. For example: If you are looking for a shirt that helps your dog feel warm, buy a shirt made of wool, cotton, or acrylic. If you expect your dog to stay dry all the time, opt for a waterproof coat that prevents moisture from sticking to the dog's skin. [3]
- If you are buying a dog's shirt for the sake of showing off, make sure you check the position of a zipper, button or lanyard that could slip off or injure the dog. Don't endanger your dog's safety with just a few trendy tops.

### 2.2 Compare measurements and shirt sizes. 

After you find a shirt you like, look at the appropriate size on the packaging of the shirt. You will see a series of measurements corresponding to the appropriate sizes. Check that the size matches your dog's bust and length measurements. Some shirts even specify the size chart for each breed. [4]
- Since each dog has its own characteristics, the actual measurement will be much more accurate than the general measurement for each breed. For example: If you have an unusually large Border Collie, you should opt for a small Labrador shirt instead of the standard size for the Border Collie.

### 2.3 Think how much you want the shirt to fit. 

If your dog's size is between the standard sizes then go for the smaller or larger size. If you only buy a nice shirt, you should choose a small size and loosen the lanyard. If you want to protect your dog from inclement weather, choose a larger size that can tighten the leash. [5]
- As a rule of thumb, if your dog is big, short, and stout like a Staffie, then go for a large size. If your dog is slender like a Whippet, choose a small size.
- If your dog has short legs, you may want to opt for a smaller size so the shirt won't drag on the floor. You may even have to find a shirt designed specifically for a dwarf that has a long body so it doesn't touch the floor.

> Advice
- When measuring a dog's shirt, the cloth tape measure is the easiest ruler to use because it is easy to stretch to the desired size and can be wrapped around the dog's body.
