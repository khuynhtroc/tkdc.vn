> Imagine that you are happily jogging in a park or cycling around the neighborhood when suddenly a strange dog comes to show its fangs and prepares to attack you. What should you do? There is a right and wrong response when attacked by a dog. You need to keep yourself safe by staying calm and taking steps to handle the situation.

## 1. Prevent attack

### 1.1 Don't panic. 

The old adage that dogs and other animals can "sense fear" is also somewhat true. If you get agitated and run away or scream, you may make the dog more reckless to attack, or worse still, make you a threat. Neither of those situations are good.

![Handle-a-Dog-Attack-Step-2]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-respond-to-a-dog-attack/v4-728px-Handle-a-Dog-Attack-Step-2-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 1.2 Keep your posture stiff and motionless. 

When the dog approaches, stand still, hands on your sides, posture like a tree, and avert your eyes. [1] In many cases, the dog will lose interest and walk away if you ignore it.
- Don't wave your arms or kick your feet; the dog will take on such actions as a threat.
- Do not look the dog in the eye, as it may cause the dog to attack.
- Stand aside and watch over your dog instead of facing the dog and making eye contact. This signals the dog that you are not a threat.
- Don't open your hand and raise your arm up high. Clasp your hands to avoid being bitten by your dog. The dog can approach you and even sniff you without biting.

### 1.3 Don't try to run away. 

Running away can awaken your dog's hunting instincts. It may aggressively chase you even though it is intended for fun at first. Furthermore, you cannot run faster than a dog if you are jogging. Even more dogs can catch up even when you ride a bike. [2]

### 1.4 Distract your dog with another object. 

If the dog continues to threaten, give him something to chew on, such as a backpack or water bottle: anything but your arms or legs. This can distract the dog for a while enough for you to escape.
- You may want to bring a toy or treat to lure your dog with you when passing areas where you know aggressive dogs are common. If an aggressive dog approaches, throw away the food or toy. The dog will probably chase them and leave you alone.

## 2. Precaution and self-defense

### 2.1 Face the dog and say, "step back". 

If the dog is still aggressive and the ignoring or soothing attitude doesn't work, confront it and sternly order it to retreat.
- Use a low, strong, and assertive voice.
- Continue to avoid eye contact.
- The dog may get discouraged or scared and walk away.

### 2.2 Fight back when the dog attacks. 

If the dog starts to bite you, you have to defend yourself. Hit or kick the dog's throat, nose and nape to shock him and you have time to escape. [3]
- You can exclaim now. Should call for help while fighting the dog. Hope someone hears you and comes to your aid. Avoid squealing, however, as this may increase the dog's attack.
- If you have a cane or a weapon, you can (and should) hit the dog. However, do not hit the dog's head; Dogs usually have a very thick skull, so this will only intensify their anger. If available, this can also be a good defense against dog attack.
- Fighting back as if this fight was your whole life, because it is. A dog's attack can be fatal. Although you don't want to hurt a dog if you don't need it, you do need to use strength when you are really attacked.

### 2.3 Take advantage of your weight. 

Use your full body weight on the animal, especially use hard points like the knees and elbows to press down. Dogs are very strong biting creatures, but they cannot resist, so try to take advantage of their position and quickly knock them down. Stand on top of the animal and focus the force on parts such as the throat or ribs, and pay attention to move the face away from the animal's scratching or bite.
- If you want a more humane and actionable solution, ride the dog on the back of your dog with part of his weight and put pressure on the dog's back to keep him still until help arrives.

### 2.4 Protect face, chest and throat. 

If you fall to the ground while being attacked, not only will it be more difficult for you to fight off an angry dog, but also to the important parts of your body, head and neck that will be vulnerable as well. Those are the most important points on your body that you need to protect, as the bites in these places cause the most damage and have the highest risk of death.
- Protect vital parts [4] by leaning over, bending your knees, and bringing your hands to your ears (fist).
- Try not to yell or roll away, as this may further agitate the dog. [5]

### 2.5 Slowly and carefully leave the place. 

When the dog is less attentive to you, leave the area by slowly backing away without making any sudden movements. [6] Staying calm and still can be a real test for your nerves in such stressful situations, but it's the best response when the dog isn't actually biting.

## 3. Handling the consequences

### 3.1 Take care of your wounds. 

If you are bitten by a dog, be sure to take care of the wound immediately, as even a slight bite can cause an infection. Perform first aid procedures for dog bites:
- Gently press on the wound to stop the bleeding. Use a clean cloth or sterile gauze bandage. If the bleeding is severe or does not stop bleeding after being pressed for many minutes, seek medical attention.
- Wash the wound thoroughly. Use warm water and soap to gently wash the wound.
- Dressing. Use a band-aid (for all minor cuts) or sterile gauze for large cuts.
- Look closely for signs of infection such as redness, warmth, tenderness, or oozing pus. See your doctor if any of these symptoms appear.

### 3.2 Call the authorities. 

It is important to determine if your attacking dog has rabies or a history of aggression. Call the authorities as soon as possible after the dog's attack to prevent the dog from harming anyone further, in addition to being checked for disease.
- If it is a wandering dog, it may attack others as well. Getting out of that area is the best way to ensure the safety of yourself and others.
- For dogs with owners nearby, how the situation has been handled is up to you. If you are injured, you may take legal action. Many states in the United States have laws that hold dog owners responsible for the consequences of their dogs.

### 3.3 Seek immediate medical attention. 

If you have been bitten by a wandering dog, a dog known to have rabies, or a dog drooling, it is imperative that you see a doctor immediately for fatal rabies prevention treatment.
- If necessary, rabies shots should be given as soon as possible after a bite.
- Most countries in Europe are considered "rabies-free", so a rabies vaccination may not be necessary if you have been attacked by a dog in Europe.
- If you haven't been vaccinated against tetanus in the past 5 years, you may need additional tetanus preventive treatment.
- In general, serious injuries caused by a dog attack should be examined by a medical professional.

## 4. Preventing attacks

![Handle-a-Dog-Attack-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/dogs/how-to-respond-to-a-dog-attack/v4-728px-Handle-a-Dog-Attack-Step-13-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Pay attention to the warning signs. 

Dogs are often not aggressive, but they are curious or guarding where they consider their territory. Therefore, in order to avoid unnecessary conflict, it is important to know whether a dog is just playing or is really aggressive. Some breeds are considered particularly aggressive, but any large or medium sized dog can be dangerous, [7] so don't ignore the warning signs because you think some breeds are dangerous. Any dog ​​is harmless or friendly. Watch for common signs of aggression (or non-aggression):[8]
- Growling, bowing of fangs are obvious signs of aggression and must be handled in the right way.
- An angry dog ​​can roll its eyes, especially if that's not the case.
- A tail that is tilted back and close to the head is a sign of aggression, while a naturally soft and erect dog ear is often a sign of indifference.
- If the dog approaches you but has a relaxed body and a bent center, the dog may not attack.
- When a dog's body is tense, tense and stiff (head, shoulders and hips are in line) there is a problem.
- The uplifting posture indicates that the dog is happy and curious about you. A steady running posture means the dog can be dangerous.

### 4.2 Avoid teasing your dog. 

Most dog attacks occur due to the dog's lack of restraint, poor training or irritability. Unfortunately, this world will never run out of bad dog owners, so it's wise to be on the lookout. Common sense tells you not to make fun of any animal.
- Never disturb a dog eating or caring for a dog. During such times, the dog will be more defensive.
- Avoid smiling with your dog. You may think you have a friendly face and an open smile, but an aggressive dog will assume you are bared your teeth and ready to fight.
- A dog that has been chained or leashed for a long period of time is more likely to be aggressive, so do not come within its reach.

### 4.3 Consider all strange dogs a threat. 

In general, the best rule of thumb when attacked by a dog is to do everything you can to avoid in the first place. If a dog seems dangerous, stay away.
- Report any dogs that appear dangerous or may be wandering in your area to the authorities.
- Teach your children never to approach unfamiliar dogs until they are sure they are safe.
- By staying away from all unfamiliar dogs, you can avoid the majority of dangerous situations facing them.

> Advice
- If you are traveling with small children, especially if you meet a large dog, you may need to hold them in your arms. When you lift the baby, you need to move slowly. Avoid making eye contact with the dog, especially if you are bent over. Have your child calm, quiet, and look at you.
- Teach your child to remember “never run away when meeting a dog, make a tree or a log” in case the child comes face-to-face with a ferocious dog.
- If you are cycling, get off the bike and use the bike to block between you and the dog as a guard. If the dog attacks (not just barking), use the bike as a weapon against the dog. Grasp the handlebars (handlebars) and saddle, and toss the wheel and hit the dog. Don't let your fingers slip, because if so you lose a valuable self-defense tool.
- If you are afraid of encountering a bad dog, bring a can of pepper spray, an air horn, or a can of compressed air to startle your dog and stop attacking. Aim for the dog's face, but if you forget it, spray it near his face or on his body is enough, as his nose is very sensitive. In this case, you should continue to spray until the dog stops.
- Dogs can sense fear, but they can also feel your resolve to defend, unless the dog is really aggressive (rabies, has a history of abuse or despair, etc.)
- Never turn your back to the dog, always observe the dog but avoid looking directly at it. Don't try to be more intimidating than the dog or make sudden movements. Take care to keep your movements slow and even. Do not approach the dog or turn away until the dog shows no signs of aggression.
- If the dog turns toward you and howls, continue walking and get out of the way slowly, avoiding eye contact as much as possible.
- If a dog runs towards you, do not run whatever you do. Maybe the dog is not angry and just wants to play with you or get acquainted. But if you run, it can get agitated. Even if a dog's appearance may be bad, that doesn't mean it will harm you. Dogs need to be loved too!
- If the dog's ears are tilted back and close to the head, it is a sign of fear. If the dog's ears are raised and directed towards you, it is more likely to be a sign of aggression or aggression.
- Dogs belong to the wolf family, but try to fight it.
- Handle it in a firm manner and go to hospital if you have been bitten by a dog; dog bites can spread rabies and / or infection.

> Warning
- The owner of aggressive dogs can be worse than their own. If you are forced to injure or kill the dog that attacked you, leave the scene and call the police as soon as possible.
- Every dog ​​is different, and dogs sometimes react very unexpectedly. These tips will keep you out of harm in most cases, but you may have to respond to the attack immediately, so be alert.
- Be careful when using pepper spray. The ability to spray the dog's face properly before it can strike you is quite low, and if you are in the wind, you will suffer from over-spraying. Even if you spray the dog in the face, you may only make him angry, especially if the dog is an angry dog.
- If the dog appears sick or falls ill within ten days of the accident, it should be tested for rabies immediately. If the test is positive for rabies, you will need a series of rabies shots.
- Remember that some breeds are "slow to wag their tails" (for example, some extremely friendly breeds like the Akitas only start wagging their tails when they are 2 meters away), so don't assume that the dog is approaching. You are about to attack you just because they are not wagging their tails.
