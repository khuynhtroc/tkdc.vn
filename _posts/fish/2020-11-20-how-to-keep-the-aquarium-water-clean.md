## 1. Installation of the aquarium

### 1.1 Wait for the water to clear up. 

Sometimes the turbid water will go away on its own when the water is adjusted. Usually cloudy water is caused by a mixture of microorganisms such as bacteria, protozoa, and multicellular organisms. These organisms come from fish, food and waste from fish kept in the tank. Usually, the aquarium water will rebalance and clean itself in about a week.
- Please be patient. Before using chemicals or taking aggressive measures to treat turbid water, be sure your tank is full of microorganisms. You should find out what could be causing the water to become cloudy before you treat it. Unnecessary chemicals and cleaners can disturb the environment in the aquarium and be harmful to the fish.

### 1.2 Supplement with probiotics. 

The added amount of probiotics will help the tank's natural treatment within a few days. You can buy store-packed bacteria or buy bacteria-packed stones. Alternatively, you can also drop gravel, stone, driftwood, or filter water from a stabilized aquarium into your aquarium. These things already have bacteria living on them.
- The bacteria will help to reduce harmful ammonia and nitrites, turning them into less toxic nitrates, which are then removed during the water's metabolism. [1] The bacteria that work best for this are Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter. [2]
- To keep bacteria in the tank, avoid cleaning the filter element and use tweezers to remove fish waste from the filter.

### 1.3 Plant suitable aquatic plants in the aquarium. 

Another way to keep your tank's water clean is to grow a plant. Aquatic plants carry many types of beneficial bacteria, and also work to filter water. You can buy plants at an aquarium store.

### 1.4 Determine if your filter is appropriate. 

Aquarium filters come in a variety of types with different effects on aquarium fish. Turbidity in the tank could also be the result of an incorrect filter used. You will need to select a filter based on the density of the fish, the type of aquarium, as well as aquarium plants or artificial plants in the tank.
- There are three types of filters to choose from. The mechanical filter removes impurities by pushing water through the material to retain impurities. Biofilters use bacteria to convert toxins into less toxic ones. Chemical filters use chemicals to remove toxins or chemicals from the water.
- Choose a strainer that has the greatest capacity possible, but keep in mind that some fish species such as beta fish and ax fish cannot tolerate the strong currents produced by the filtration.

### 1.5 Think carefully when adding fish to the tank. 

Do not put too many fish into the tank, as this can cause health problems for the fish and make the tank harder to clean. For goldfish, the general rule is 75 liters of water for the first fish, and add 30 liters of water for each subsequent fish. Research the fish you want to keep to determine the size of the tank you need. [3]

## 2. Maintain the aquarium

![Keep-Aquarium-Water-Clear-Step-6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-keep-the-aquarium-water-clean/v4-728px-Keep-Aquarium-Water-Clear-Step-6.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Change the aquarium water. 

A general rule of thumb is to change 20% of the water in the tank a week. If you are using tap water, you will need to leave the water outside for 2 days. This will help the chlorine in the water evaporate, and bring the water temperature to room temperature so the fish won't be shocked when you fill the tank. Chlorinated chemicals remove chlorine and reduce stress in the fish. You can also add an antidote to the water to prevent fish disease. [4]
- You can also buy a device that attaches to the tap to remove gravel when draining and changing water. You won't have to wait a few days to do this, but make sure the water temperature is close to the temperature in the aquarium, and be sure to add a chlorine supplement.

### 2.2 Keep the filter clean. 

Make sure the filter is new and in good working order. The filter works to create a healthy and favorable environment in the aquarium, so if you do not replace the filter or do not pay attention to maintenance, the water in the tank can become cloudy or even kill the fish. Read the filter user manual for instructions on how to service the device.
- All filters should be checked monthly and replaced if necessary. You should check weekly to make sure the filter is not clogged or free of deposits. Remember to clean or replace if necessary.
- When cleaning the filter element, use tweezers to remove fish waste and other clogging material. Do not flush the filter element with water to avoid the loss of bacteria that help reduce ammonia and nitrite. The bacteria will brown when growing in the filter cartridge.
- Read the pump operator's manual to make sure it is installed and working properly. The pump plays an important role in the aeration and supply of oxygen in the air to the aquarium. Fish in the tank will be affected if the pump is not working properly, especially if the water is cloudy due to the waste.

## 3. Treatment of cloudy water

### 3.1 Watch out for bacterial outbreaks. 

After changes in the aquarium, such as a large water change, a thorough cleaning or medication to cure the fish, can occur. Be patient if the water in the tank becomes cloudy because of these reasons. The bacteria will return to balance within a few days, and the water will automatically clear again. [5]

### 3.2 Filter test. 

If the water filter is not working properly, the water in the tank may become cloudy. In the filtration system there are bacteria that process the produced byproducts, such as ammonia, while keeping the water clean. If the filter stops working, bacteria can build up in the water and make it cloudy. [6]

### 3.3 Adjust the fish stocking. 

If you have just added new fish to your tank, you will need to make sure your tank responds to the number of fish you add. For example, if you put large fish in a tank where you are keeping small fish, the filtration system may not be able to handle it. You should install another filtration system or reduce the number of fish in the tank. [7]

### 3.4 Try not to overfeed the fish. 

The water can become cloudy if you feed the fish too much. The fish should only be fed just enough. You can feed your fish once a day with a small amount of feed and fast for a day or two per week.

![Keep-Aquarium-Water-Clear-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-keep-the-aquarium-water-clean/v4-728px-Keep-Aquarium-Water-Clear-Step-13.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Be careful with the decorations. 

Sometimes the water is turbid due to tank decorations. Make sure you wash all items before you put them in the tank. Check everything to make sure they are designed to be used in the aquarium and buy it from a pet supply store. [8]
- Check trims for melt, deformation, loose, peeling paint, or discoloration.

### 3.6 Control algae. 

Green algae cling to the walls of the aquarium and sometimes cling to aquarium decorations. The water changes are the best time to scrape algae on the walls of the tank. Use a soft plastic brush to gently scrape off the wall of the tank, then dip it into water to rinse it off before continuing to shave elsewhere. Remove all decorations from the tank and scour under clean running water. [9]
- Do not over-illuminate the aquarium, as this can cause the algae to multiply. Do not place the aquarium near a window, and let the light shine only in the tank for 10-12 hours a day. [ten]
- It's important not to overfeed the fish, as leftovers can contribute to the algal growth.

> Advice
- Rotting organic matter is often the cause of bacterial outbursts and cloudy water. You need to check to make sure there are no dead organisms in the tank.
- Do not put too many fish into the tank; otherwise, it will be difficult to keep the water clean.
- Usually, the water test will clear itself. Please be patient.
- Make sure to install the filter and pump correctly according to the manufacturer's instructions.
- You may need to thoroughly clean the tank - gravel, filters, decorations, and a complete water change. However, you should only do this after you've tried all the other methods.
