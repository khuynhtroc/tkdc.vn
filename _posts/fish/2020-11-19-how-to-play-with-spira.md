## 1. Add entertainment to the Betta Aquarium

### 1.1 Put some decorations on the perineum. 

Bettas are curious fish and they indulge in discovering new things. They also love to have places to hide and relax in their "territory", so adding a few interesting items to the tank is key to the betta's happiness.
- What is put in the fish bowl is what makes the fish bowl more lively and must be clean, insoluble in water, non-toxic. If it is small enough and clean enough, you can put it in your betta fish tank.
- There are a variety of products that are made specifically for bettas. Consider and potted your pot with at least a fake plant so your pet can hide or rest in it. [2]
- Besides giving your bettas places to hide and explore, you also need to give them enough space to swim around freely and freely. Do not let your fish tank get filled with contents. [3]

### 1.2 Should add moving objects to the water surface. 

Small toys or fishing floats are a good idea. You should not cover the entire surface of the water with the toy as the bettas need to get up to get air. A few interesting objects floating on the water are enough for the fish to play with.
- Make sure these interesting toys are really clean before you put them in the fish bowl.
- Drop a small plastic ball into the fish bowl. [4] And let's see what they do with it! Some fish will push the ball around the pot. If the fish doesn't play with the ball right away, give them time to get used to first.

### 1.3 Feed your betta with raw food from time to time. 

Land is a great way to reward your fish. Stores that specialize in aquarium fish often offer live worms that most bettas will chase after to eat with enthusiasm.
- Always feed your bettas a balanced and varied diet. Overfeeding is not good for the fish as this fish can go hungry for a period of time without any problems. So don't overfeed your fish if you don't want them to be sick.

## 2. Play with your Betta fish

### 2.1 Move your finger up and down the outside of the fish bowl. [5] 

The fish will move with your finger. Sometimes, the Betta will swim along if it realizes you are the one taking care of it.
- Try getting the fish to follow the different patterns you make with your fingers. A snap of your finger for example?

### 2.2 Train your betta to eat food from your hands. 

When feeding the fish, make sure the fish swims in and understands that it is the food you give it. Once the fish gets close to the food, keep your hands above the water while they eat. Gradually, you can switch to lightly holding the food in the water between your thumb and index finger.
- While training the fish, feed the fish what it likes. Betta can even jump if you keep the worms or insects above the water a little.

### 2.3 Teach your fish to swim, and possibly even jump in the water or jump over a hoop. 

Make the ring with a clean tube or plastic pad. Find out what bettas like to eat the most, and use them as bait. Hang the hoop in the pot so the fish can swim through it. Move the bait to encourage the betta to swim through the ring.
- Once your fish gets used to swimming over the ring, raise the bracelet little by little until the ring barely touches the water. With practice, your fish can jump to the surface of the water and through a hoop to get food.
- Always remember not to overfeed your fish. It's okay to have a little bit of exercise food, but don't overfeed them or it could lead to sick or dead fish.

### 2.4 Make your fish "open up" by placing a mirror in the pot. [6] 

Show the fish yourself in the mirror for a few minutes. When he sees himself in the mirror he thinks there is another fish in the tank. The male Bettas are quite aggressive and are always fighting for territory, so when they think there is another fish, they will open their fins.
- There are still some mixed opinions as to whether this exercise is good for the Betta or not.

### 2.5 Targeted training is another way to have fun with your betta, and opens the door to countless other ways to play with the fish. [7]

- First, find a suitable plastic stick, straw or wand to poke into the aquarium. It's best to find something bright in color, so that the fish can easily spot it.
- Poke the plant into the tank and when the fish touches its nose, reward it with food. Do this several times a day, taking care to avoid overeating the fish.
- Finally, you can use this plant to train fish to swim through circles, chase trees and even jump into the water. Be careful not to get too tired of exercise, and always wash the plant thoroughly before use.

> Warning
- Do not pet the Betta too much. This is not good for them, as it will remove the natural greasy layer on them, causing the fish to lose its ability to fight some diseases. Therefore, never touch them when your hands are dirty, some bacteria can easily get into the fish's body through this direct contact.
- Never put objects with surfaces that are chipped or thawed in water in a fish bowl. Objects, such as stained stones, melt and the chemicals can hurt or kill your aquarium fish.
- Never tap your finger on the glass if it's a pot or bowl. Betta fish are highly territorial, so tapping a finger on a pot will frighten them and the fish can die in shock.
