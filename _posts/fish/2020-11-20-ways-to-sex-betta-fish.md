## 1. Recognize through external characteristics

### 1.1 Characteristics begin to develop as the fish grows. [1] 

Male and female Betta fish are often very similar when they are young because their bodies are still underdeveloped and their sexual characteristics are still not evident. You need to wait until you can identify the characteristics of the male or around the time the Betta is 2 months old.

### 1.2 Observe the size and shape of the fin. [2] 

Male Bettas generally have an upper dorsal, ventral and caudal fin in general. Usually the fins are 2 to 3 times longer than the body height. The dorsal and tail fins will droop as they lengthen. Female Bettas' fins are usually shorter even when their body height is taller or shorter than that of male Bettas. The female's pelvic fins are shaped like a comb.
- Short fins can be considered characteristic of females, but should be combined with other traits before their sex is determined.

### 1.3 Observe the colors. [3] 

Males are usually more colorful than females. The color of the female tends to be mild and not bright, especially the torso. Blue, green, and red on the body and fins are characteristic signs of males.
- Color can vary depending on the level of agitation of the fish. Females that are under stress will have more vibrant colors than normal females.

### 1.4 Observe the spawning organ. [4] 

The female has a small white spot under her abdomen or fallopian tube. This white spot looks like a grain of salt. It is located just between the edge of the anterior ventral fins and so on. This is one way of identifying a female Betta, the male will never have this white spot.
- Finding this white spot is difficult when the fish is young when the genitals are not fully developed. In adults, the fallopian tubes will be larger and more noticeable.
- If you have trouble finding the fallopian tubes, consider feeding them. Usually they will swim up and tilt, so that you can see more easily.

### 1.5 Compare your body shape. [5] 

Male and female Bettas have slight differences in the body. The male body is usually long and slim while the female is shorter and the belly is somewhat larger. This is a very subtle difference. For this method, you need to closely observe the male to clearly distinguish their sex. Females will appear fatter than males.

### 1.6 Place a mirror next to the aquarium. 

Males will flare up when they meet another male of the same sex. [6] Both male and female Betta fish are very aggressive. However, males tend to be more aggressive. If you put a mirror next to or inside the aquarium, they will assume they have another one. The male will stretch or puff its gills to show dominance. They will approach the mirror.
- The female Betta also puffed out from time to time to show power. However, females are generally less aggressive than males. Males tend to become agitated when another male is approaching.
- Do not place mirrors in the aquarium for long periods of time. Seeing Bettas act aggressively makes you excited, but this can seriously affect their health. Especially for males, their fins can be shortened if they go through long periods of crisis.

## 2. Gender discrimination through behavior

### 2.1 Consider selling methods. 

The trading method also helps you to know the sex of the Betta fish. Male Bettas are commonly sold in the pet store because of their eye-catching appearance with wide fins and vibrant colors. Thanks to these typical traits, most pet stores sell only male Betta breeds. Female Bettas are mainly sold by the aquarium enthusiast or high end aquarium shops.
- The staff in pet stores have a broader understanding of pets than you do. However, their expertise is limited and they only have knowledge of the animals they love or sell a lot. When you hear the sex selection counselor, ask if he or she has ever raised Bettas on his own, or if they have to look at the label before telling you what a male it is. Where are the children. If in doubt, just assume it is a male Betta.

### 2.2 Watch for foam. [7] 

When the males are ready to mate, they often release water bubbles on the surface of the tank. They create hundreds of thousands of tiny water bubbles that bind together. This is clearly the preparation for fertilization. Male Bettas are the primary caregiver for their offspring.

### 2.3 Observe the Betta's antennae on the gills. [8] 

Both male and female Bettas have a membrane under their gills, which is a different color from their body. Usually their beard is brown or black, Males have a larger beard than females. You can only see the beards of the female when they are brought back and must be carefully observed. Male antennae are more easily identifiable even when their gills are open.

> Advice
- Betta fish sex detection is a skill that needs to be mastered. Seasoned breeders can distinguish between males even if they are only about 2cm long!
- If in doubt, check with the Betta fish specialist at your local aquarium store. It's best to go to a small but specialized store.
- If you are determining the sex of an adult Betta then size is one of the best practices. Compared to overall body size, the female is usually smaller than the male.

> Warning
- Female Bettas can be kept together under the right conditions, but males, on the other hand, should never share them in the same tank. Similarly, male and female Betta should not keep the same tank except for a short time of mating.
