### 2.6 Bring the siamese fighting fish back to the tank. 

Slowly bring the cup (where the fighter is kept) back to the tank and let the cup tilt slightly. The sardines will slowly swim out of the cup on their own. Be very gentle when doing this, as you can damage the fin.
- Watch the fish. Once released, the fish will soon begin to explore the tank. Put the tank where it was and watch the fish swim around and discover everything!

> Advice
- If you have a tank, you can change it every week. Siamese fighting fish always need a larger tank. Do not keep fish in bowls or jars because fish do not like confined spaces. The bigger the tank, the better.
- A heater is not required, but you should keep the temperature at 28 ° C. If a heater is not available, check the water temperature at room temperature regularly. Siamese fighting fish can survive well at this temperature.
- Hard sap plants should not be placed in the tank, as they can injure the fish or tear the fins. If you have a sap plant, you should 'check with socks'. Rub them over your pants and see if they cause lint or tear. If they do, they can damage the Siamese fighting fish's fins and tail. The best way is to use a silk tree or real tree, as the fish can swim around the tree. In addition, real plants provide oxygen for water.
- Make sure the tank is at least 95 liters in volume. If smaller, the fish may bite its fins because of the stress.

> Warning
- Always be careful when handling Siamese fighting fish. If you're not gentle, the fish can get hurt.
- Never leave the fish alone if you are away (more than 3 days). Ask a friend to feed the fish and change the water.
- Do not place fish near sunny windows, vents, or dusty places. Sunlight can increase algae and dusty or windy areas can increase contaminants in the tank. [4]
