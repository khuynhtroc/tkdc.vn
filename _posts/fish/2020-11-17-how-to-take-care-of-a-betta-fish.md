## 1. Know more about Betta fish

![Selectively-Breed-Betta-Fish-Step-1]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-take-care-of-a-betta-fish/v4-728px-Selectively-Breed-Betta-Fish-Step-1-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.1 Choose Betta fish. 

Here are some of the features you need to observe.
- Look at the colors of the fish. Are Bettas bright, showy, or dark and dark? Even if the color of a Betta fish is a bit pale, it still has a beautiful sparkle. Bettas have a variety of colors but the most common are blue and red (generally dark colors), sometimes, they are also white with pink or light blue.
- Does the fish react to your moves? Does it swim quickly when it sees you or is it just wandering around the bottom of the lake? Do not repeatedly knock on the sides of the bottle as you can agitate the fish. Instead, try moving your finger back and forth in front of the Betta without bothering it. If you buy a nice looking Betta, don't worry; maybe he was just resting because he had to receive so many customers to the store for the day. Usually, the Betta fish in the aquarium store has been bred to accommodate the many problems that arise as a pet.
- Are the caudal fin in perfect condition or is it torn and damaged? It is important to note that some Betta breeds have a rather complicated fins structure, so it may look like their fins are slightly torn. Are the fish's eyes normal? Are there any strange lumps (parasites) on its body? If you find anything out of the ordinary, choose another Betta fish (it will be helpful if you chat with the shop staff).
- Sometimes, the fish chooses the owner but the owner does not choose the fish. If there is a Betta that you have been looking at, then skipping, walking away from it but still looking back then consider buying it. Even if it's not quite as flexible, go ahead and buy the fish you feel connected to rather than choose the healthiest fish. Your Betta fish will quickly become flexible once out of the cramped cup and start a new life in clean, warm water.

### 1.2 Consider what you will face before deciding to buy a Betta. 

With proper care, this fish can live up to 10 years, so you need to do your homework before buying. The tank must be at least 10 liters in size and equipped with a heater and filter. Betta fish should not be kept in a bowl; the bowl is too small and very terrible for the health of the fish! Your Betta will not be able to live a long and happy life.

### 1.3 Prepare yourself for a background knowledge. 

There are a lot of things to know about Bettas, from beginner to advanced. In general, the large aquarium stores do not provide detailed information unless you are lucky enough to meet a salesperson who is passionate about Betta fish. In addition to knowing about Betta fish as mentioned above, you must find out more details about this fish on forums such as diendancaxiem.com (in Vietnam) and Bettafish.com, Bettatalk.com, ibcBettas.org (overseas), and so on. These forums are also very useful for you in the future, you can ask questions, read the health and nutrition notes and interact with soulmates to share fish stories. Betta.

## 2. Prepare the house for the Betta fish

![Set-Up-a-Betta-Tank-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-take-care-of-a-betta-fish/v4-728px-Set-Up-a-Betta-Tank-Step-9-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Prepare a new house for the Betta. 

To prevent bad risks, you should have a suitable aquarium system in place before bringing your pets home.
- Male Betta should not live with other males. Keeping female fish together is fine only if their nature is gentle and if you keep five or more children in one tank it is preferable to use a tank with a capacity of 38-57 liters, although the tank 38 liters is sufficient (as long as the fish has enough space to hide). The female colony is also called a "female community" and is sometimes difficult to keep. If you only have two Betta fish, it should not be kept together to limit the risk. If you want to keep a Betta with other fish, you should choose one that doesn't have a long tail (don't choose guppies) and is about the same size as your Betta to avoid "big fish eat small fish. ". Recommended tank grafting suggestions for you are Cherry Shrimp and White Cloud Fish.

### 2.2 Choose a suitable environment. 

In the wild, Bettas live in wet rice fields in Thailand. Therefore, their suitable habitat should be relatively shallow and spacious. To meet the wide demand and help your fish live longer, you should consider investing in a Betta tank with a large size tank. Choose a tank that is 19 liters or larger for good growth. You may think such a tank is too large, but that will allow your Betta to adapt well.

![Set-Up-a-Betta-Tank-Step-3]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-take-care-of-a-betta-fish/v4-728px-Set-Up-a-Betta-Tank-Step-3-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Supplement the necessary equipment. 

Keeping a Betta is not a simple hobby because you will need a lot of equipment:
- Stabilize water temperature with a thermostat. Because Bettas are tropical fish, preferring water with temperatures between 24 and 27ºC, you need to invest in a heater, especially if you live in a cold climate or your aquarium has a temperature. water is lower than room temperature. The mini heater is sufficient for a 4-11 liter tank. During winter (in the cold country) you will have to add a mini heater or place the aquarium near the heater (about 1 meter away), so that the Betta fish will not get cold.
- A filter is indispensable, however, ensuring that the water flow is not too strong for the fish. Remember that long fin breeds do best in environments with as light currents as possible. Some experts recommend using a foam filter to protect the fins of the fish.
- Avoid the use of sharp, serrated stones or decorations. These decorations will tear the fins of the fish. You should check once a day to make sure the Betta's fins are not torn. If you find a tear, check the water quality first as the fin tear is usually caused by poor water conditions.
- Do not add hard plastic bonsai. Again, these items can cause the fin to tear. You can use the 'sock test': if the sap can puncture the sock when you rub them together, the plastic bonsai can also damage the Betta's fins. Be careful and buy silk plants instead.
- Aquatic plants are also a good idea. Real plants will be more beautiful than fake plants, Betta fish also loves to swim through the leaves and hide there to sleep. Plants also help provide oxygen to the water and absorb the ammonia that is dangerous for fish, helping to keep the water cleaner in the long run.

![Add-a-Betta-to-a-Community-Tank-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-take-care-of-a-betta-fish/v4-728px-Add-a-Betta-to-a-Community-Tank-Step-9.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 If you plan to combine a variety of fish, do a thorough research first. 

Bettas like to live alone and can kill other fish, even snails if you let them live in the tank. Some Bettas may be fine with their tankmates, such as snails, Ma shrimp, cherry shrimp and catfish, as long as the creatures in the tank do not have pointed fins and are not larger. or more colorful Betta fish. Before adding any species of aquarium species to your tank with your Betta fish, you should find out by asking the seller, reading more books about Bettas or finding more information on these niche websites. If you are still unsure, keep the Betta in a separate tank.
- Male Betta fish cannot live together. This fish is known as the Betta fighting fish for a reason! In the aquarium environment whether big or small, they will fight each other to death to protect their territory. If you have more than one male in the same tank and don't have a baffle set up, the chances of you losing one or all of your fish numbers are extremely high.
- To minimize conflict, you should keep the female Betta alone or in groups of at least five. If you are keeping female fish in groups, choose a tank with a capacity of at least 38 liters and design some hiding places. All females must be put in the tank at the same time. Do not keep only two female Bettas in one tank. They establish a "social order", meaning that if there are only two females in the tank, the one that is less dominant becomes the only subject of bullying.
- The female Betta will also fight the male and vice versa. So should not let them live in the same tank. Read more about breeding Betta fish if you want to try it, however, breeding fish is a big responsibility and not something to be taken lightly.
- Placing a mirror along the wall of a tank may cause the fish to spread its fins because it thinks there is an opponent in its territory. This can be stressful for the fish, so avoid using mirrors.

## 3. Add water to the tank

![Set-Up-a-Betta-Tank-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-take-care-of-a-betta-fish/v4-728px-Set-Up-a-Betta-Tank-Step-12-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Prepare the water. 

Use a water stabilizer (Prime for example) before leading tap water into the tank. Chlorine and chlorine in tap water can adversely affect Bettas as well as kill beneficial bacteria. Previous sources suggested that we settle the water (let the water evaporate for a while). However, it is best to use a water stabilizer, since the chlorine has evaporated after sedimentation but cannot remove chlorine and heavy metals. Use the aquarium water test kit to make sure the water is completely circulating before you put the Betta in!
- Using bottled water is not a good idea as there are no minerals essential to Betta fish and it is not 'safe' for fish. Using treated tap water is both economical and a more appropriate choice.

### 3.2 Cover the tank. 

If your tank does not have a lid, cover the mouth of the tank about 80% or more to make sure the Betta does not jump out. Bettas are very versatile and they can pop up to 7.5 cm when motivated! However, Bettas usually do not try to jump out if they are satisfied with their home.

## 4. Release the Betta fish into the new house

![Acclimate-Your-Betta-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-take-care-of-a-betta-fish/v4-728px-Acclimate-Your-Betta-Step-10-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Put the Betta in the tank. 

First, slowly and carefully add some water from the previous tank that Betta was in. Mixing the old and new water together will help the Betta fish to adapt more easily, and if the new water environment is colder or much warmer than the old one, mixing the two types of water will reduce the risk. muscles shock the fish. However, you should put as little water in your aquarium out of the store as possible, as sometimes this water can contain pathogens or other things that you would not expect to appear in your new aquarium. me. Next, dip the cup containing the Betta fish into the tank. You have to be very careful while stocking fish!
- If possible, you should avoid picking up your Betta with a racquet, as this can damage the delicate caudal fins. If you need to catch a Betta you should use a small cup, carefully scoop it up.

## 5. Feed the Betta

![Train-Your-Betta-Fish-Step-3]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-take-care-of-a-betta-fish/v4-728px-Train-Your-Betta-Fish-Step-3-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 5.1 Provide a suitable diet for your Betta fish. 

The Betta fighting fish is a carnivore. Its diet should consist of pellets made specifically for the Betta fish, along with a variety of other fresh foods. Frozen saltwater shrimp or worms are just good options.
- Check the ingredients of the pellets and tablets. The first three ingredients should be the protein content. Experts say that the protein content of tablets should not be less than 40%.

### 5.2 Feed the fish regularly. 

Betta fish have different eating habits, so experiment to see how much food you need to feed your fish. Set a regular feeding time for your fish, such as once in the morning and once in the evening. If you stick to this schedule, once the fish gets used to it, you'll find it waiting for you when it's time to eat!
- Be careful not to overfeed the fish. Bettas' stomachs are about the same size as their eyes. Feeding the Betta too much is not good because most of them don't stop eating, you can feed them, and this can be fatal. The feeding schedule can be referred to as 3 pellets in the morning and 3 capsules in the evening. You should soak the food in water a few minutes before the tablets will expand and then feed the fish because the food may expand inside the fish's stomach and cause its stomach to swell abnormally or cause digestive obstruction. Overfeeding will lead to bloating, bloating and can lead to death, although this is not as serious as bloating has similar symptoms in fish.

### 5.3 Clean up any leftovers that the fish don't eat. 

Likewise, watch to see if your Betta fish spits out the food. If so, it is a sign that your Betta fish is anorexic or that the pellet is too large for the fish's mouth. Ironically, most fish feed companies do not realize that the mouth of a Betta is much smaller than the mouth of a goldfish or other fish.
- You can use the razor blade to cut the pellet in half or into parts to make it easier for the Betta to eat. If it still refuses to eat then try another brand of compressed or dry food.

![Train-Your-Betta-Fish-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-take-care-of-a-betta-fish/v4-728px-Train-Your-Betta-Fish-Step-8-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 5.4 Turn feeding time into an enjoyable exercise. 

Place a straw into the tank and let the Betta get used to it. Once the Betta gets used to the straw, you pick up any leftovers that the fish no longer eat, then drop a piece of leftover food back into the tank. Place the straw on the food tablet so it fits into the straw. Hold the top straw and wait for the fish to detect the food. Then the Betta will swim with the food in the straw. At this point, you can slowly lift the straw towards the top of the tank until the food falls off and the fish will grab it.

## 6. Keep the aquarium clean

### 6.1 Betta fish can only survive in a specific type of water with a certain hardness and pH. 

They take a long time to adapt to a new environment and the process is very stressful for the fish. Let the Bettas fully adapt to their new home before you make any changes to their habitat.

![Set-Up-a-Betta-Tank-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-take-care-of-a-betta-fish/v4-728px-Set-Up-a-Betta-Tank-Step-17-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 6.2 Clean the aquarium . 

Bettas do best in a recirculating aquarium with a water filter, otherwise you will need to frequently change the entire tank water (however this can be stressful for Bettas). The Betta fish's fins are very fragile, so it is best to adjust the flow slowly or use a foam filter. Carefully suck the bottom of the filter tank every time a small amount of water is changed daily. Dirty pool water is the cause of many diseases, such as fin rot. Don't worry, though, as the tank cleaning is a very easy problem to handle.
- You should add dechlorinator (also known as a tank water stabilizer) to the water; This substance helps to remove chlorine / chlorine-min harmful to fish in tap water, and filter bacteria.
- Make sure the water you just changed is at the same temperature as the old water in the tank to avoid heat shock, leading to fish death. Use an aquarium thermometer to check the water temperature.

![Set-Up-a-Betta-Tank-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-take-care-of-a-betta-fish/v4-728px-Set-Up-a-Betta-Tank-Step-13-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 6.3 Check tank water every week. 

To check your water parameters each week, you will need to use a water test kit. Following the water testing instructions provided by the manufacturer, this allows you to monitor the tank and keep an eye on the water situation in the tank.
- Make a note on your calendar or diary so as not to forget the time for your water test.

## 7. Enjoy your aquarium show

### 7.1 Play with a new friend. 

Betta fish can recognize its owner. They can also memorize faces and play simple games. Become a friend of the fish and greet them often so that the fish gets to know you!
- The Betta is very curious and often develops an affection for its caregiver.

![Train-Your-Betta-Fish-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-take-care-of-a-betta-fish/v4-728px-Train-Your-Betta-Fish-Step-9-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 7.2 Play with Betta fish. 

Watching and spending time playing with Betta fish is very interesting. You can play with the fish by moving your finger back and forth outside the wall of the tank (do not bump into the wall or immerse your hand in the water). Watch the Betta swim with you. And best of all, don't forget to name it!

### 7.3 Never knock against the wall of the tank. 

This behavior is easy to excite the fish and can cause it to shock, leading to death. To interact through the action, simply place your finger on the glass and gently slide it back and forth to watch the Betta swim with your finger. If it backs away and looks frightened, stop. You can try this again after the Betta has gotten to know you and is no longer afraid of you. Never place a mirror in front of the fish as they can change color and become aggressive, which can stress the fish.

## 8. Interesting facts about Betta fish

### 8.1 Some very nice things about this Betta fighting fish:

- The Betta is a species in the Anabantoid family (the ornamental gourd belongs to this family). They have a backup respiration system that allows the fish to get oxygen directly from the air, however, they still need a filtration system in the tank.
- Females are usually smaller than males. The shape of the female's fin is not as good as the male's. However, the female is still very beautiful in her own way and extremely aggressive! They should not be kept together as the female may chase the live fins of the male and cause the male to tear.
- When a Betta makes a bubble nest (releasing a bubble in the water) does not mean they are having fun, this shows that the Betta is preparing to spawn.
- When the male likes a female, the male will bulge the gills, curl and spread her fins. When the female likes a male, the female will swing back and forth in front of the male.
- They are also known as 'Betta Fighting Fish.'
- The typical Betta for sale in aquarium stores is the Betta splendens . There are still many more rare species that mainly live in the wild and they can look like a completely different fish!

> Advice
- Remember that if your Betta suddenly becomes passive when you first change the water, it could be because the water is too hot or too cold.
- Rinse the decorations before placing them in the tank!Betta fish often sleep in unusual positions, sometimes even look dead. This is completely normal. However, if your Betta stays in the tank for too long / is breathing too fast then they may be sick
- The young Betta should not be stocked with the adult Betta as they can fight each other.
- If you are a child, you may have difficulty taking care of your Betta. Ask a parent or guardian for help.
- Make sure the Betta fish habitat has a bit of sunlight, but don't put them directly under direct sunlight as they can die from the heat!
- Always check the health of the Betta fish.
- Don't overfeed your Betta!
- Clean the tank once a month.
- Do not keep Betta fish together. They will kill each other. You should also avoid placing a glass or mirror in the tank as the Betta will attack herself in the mirror!

> Warning
- Water filters that suck or blow too hard can cause fluctuations in the water around Betta fish and potentially damage their delicate caudal fins. Choose to buy a water purifier with adjustable blowing rate.
- Betta fish are very sensitive to temperature. In general, a small change of about 2-3 ° C can also weaken their immune system. If you can afford it, invest in a heater to use it.
- Do not use distilled water. Distilled water is water where all minerals and nutrients are completely removed. Wild Bettas do not live in distilled water, so forcing them to adapt to this can be detrimental to fish health.
- If you keep other fish, avoid choosing fish with a lighter color (such as guppies) and a longer droopy tail (guppies, goldfish, etc.) your Betta. Bettas can mistake any showy fish in the tank for another Betta. Avoid keeping Betta fish with aggressive fish or pointed fins, such as carp in the carp family. Zebras, some Tetra fish and most species of mackerel can all get along well with Betta fish. Bottom-eating fish such as the aquarium rat and the ottocinclus (otocinclus) are also good options. Check out the aquarium forums for more suggestions.
- Of course, you also cannot keep a Betta in a bowl, cup, or aquarium with a capacity of less than 10 liters. They also need the right living space!
