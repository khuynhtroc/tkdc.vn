### 1.1 Prepare a first aid kit. 

The aquarium shops usually do not sell medicine for the fighting fish, that means you will have to order it online. If you do this after the fish is already sick, it may be too late.
- A complete first aid kit is usually available online. However, you can save money by ordering only the essentials. The basic medicines are: Bettazing or Bettamax, Kanamycin, Tetracycline, Amplicillin, Jungle Fungus Eliminator, Maracin 1, and Maracyn 2. [1]

### 1.2 Prevention of fish diseases. 

Most diseases of the Siamese fighting fish are caused by improper feeding and hygiene. These issues will be discussed in more detail in the next section. However, here are a few things that you need to remember:
- Clean the tank regularly. To keep the tank clean, you need to avoid over-stocking the tank, remember to use aquarium salt (the salt used in the aquarium) and disinfect the tank.
- To limit the spread of the disease, you need to immediately remove dead fish, isolate newly purchased fish for 2 weeks before placing fish in the tank and wash your hands after handling the fish. [2]
- Do not overfeed the fish or allow food to rot in the tank. [3]

### 1.3 Know how to spot the first signs of an infection. 

The most obvious way to tell if a Siamese fighting fish is sick is to observe it eating it. If a fish does not eat or does not seem interested in seeing food, it is probably sick. The fish's blood color becomes pale or abnormally discolored are also signs that the fish is sick. [4]
- Other signs of infection include: the fish rubs itself against the wall of the tank as if trying to scratch; swollen and bulging eyes; flake up; leaden; fins are clustered instead of spreading. [5]

## 2. Treat specific diseases

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-4]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-4-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Start with food and water treatment. 

Most fish diseases can be treated by washing and disinfecting the aquarium. Whatever the disease, you should try this method first, then switch to medication if the situation does not improve.
- Keep track of the symptoms in case you need to consult your veterinarian about treating the fish.
- Quickly remove the diseased fish from the tank.

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-5]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-5-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Treat fungal diseases. 

Infected fish will appear paler than usual, become inactive, and fins will often cluster. The most recognizable sign is white, fluffy patches on the body of the fish. [6]
- Treat fish fungus by cleaning the tank and treating fresh water with a fungicide. Repeat every 3 days until no visible signs of fungal infection remain. Treat the water with BettaZing or Bettamax to decompose all remaining fungi.
- Fungal infections are often the result of an aquarium not being properly treated with salt and Aquarisol.
- Fungal diseases are very contagious, so you need to treat them quickly. Immediately isolate the sick fish. [7]

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-6-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Treatment of tail and fin rot. 

In this case, along the edge of the fighter's fins and / or tail will turn black or red. The fins appear to be decomposed and shortened. You may see holes or tears in the fins. [8]
- Clean the tank every 3 days. Treat the water with ampicillin or tetracycline. Repeat this procedure until the fish fins no longer see any signs of tissue necrosis. Add a little fungicide to the water to help the fish recover.
- The tail will gradually heal on its own but may not be as bright as it once was. [9]
- If left untreated, the disease can progress to the point of corroding the fish's body, and eventually the fish will die.

### 2.4 Treatment of bubble disorders. 

If the fish's stomach bulges, it may have an organ blockage that needs treatment. You may find that there is no fish waste in the tank. The fish may not be able to swim straight, but only swim sideways, even on its stomach.
- This is a sign of overfeeding. This disease can be easily treated by reducing the amount of food you feed your fish.

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-8-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.5 Treatment of white spot (ich). 

Your fish will probably have white spots all over the body and loss of appetite. Fish also try to rub themselves against objects in the tank. This disease is highly contagious and is the most common cause of fish death. [ten]
- To treat white spot, increase the water temperature in the tank up to 25.5 - 26.5 degrees C in 4 hours. Add formalin or malachite green to the water. [11]

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-9-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.6 Treating velvet fungus. 

Velvet fungus causes the fish fins to press close to the body, the fish becomes discolored, stops eating and rubs against the gravel in the tank. The disease is curable but it can be difficult to detect. To determine if a fish has velvet, shine a flashlight on the fish and see for a yellow glow or rust colored film. [twelfth]
- Treat velvet by cleaning the tank and treating fresh water with BettaZing.
- Velvet fungus won't happen if you treat your tank properly with salt and a water treatment product. If your fish has velvet infection, you should review your tank care.

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-10-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.7 Treatment of bulging eyes. 

If one of the ankles is bulging, then the fish will have protrusion. Unfortunately, bulging eyes are not caused by just one disease. Some cases are curable, some are incurable. [13]
- If there are a lot of fish with bulging eyes, then perhaps water is the culprit. Test the water and do a 30% water change every day for 4-5 days.
- If one of the fish in the tank has protruding eyes, it may be infected. Take the fish to a separate tank and treat the fish with Maracyn or Maracyn II until signs of improvement.
- Raising the eye is sometimes the result of a serious and incurable illness. If the fish doesn't respond to the medication, there's probably nothing you can do about it. [14]

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-11-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.8 Identify edema disease. 

With edema disease, the fish's belly will begin to swell. When the fish's belly is swollen, the fish's scales will be ruffled to look like a pine. This is not a specific disease, but a sign that the fish loses its ability to regulate fluids and dies. [15]
- If found early, the edema can be treated with aquarium salt and medicine. However, since it is difficult to determine which medicine is suitable (taking the wrong medicine can make the situation worse), it is not easy to handle it. Your veterinarian can help. If the fish is seriously ill, you may want to help the fish die smoothly.
- Edema is not contagious but can be a sign that the aquarium water parameters are not correct. You should check and consider changing the water. [16]

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-12-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.9 Consult an aquatic veterinarian. 

The aquatic veterinarian specializes in fish and is not as popular as the cat and dog therapists and other domestic animals. If you are in the US, look for this database to see if there are any doctors near you.

## 3. Change the fish farming environment

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-13-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Buy a larger aquarium. 

A Siamese fighting fish needs an aquarium with a minimum capacity of 10 liters. If you have more than one fish, you should buy a larger aquarium to accommodate all the fish in the tank. [17]
- If you have a large aquarium, you probably won't need to change the water as often. Toxins will accumulate faster and have higher concentration in small tanks.

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-14-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Test the water in the tank. 

A well-balanced pH helps to limit ammonia, nitrite and nitrate levels, which in turn helps keep the fish healthy. The ideal pH is 7. [18]
- Treat the water with chlorine bleach. Use according to the manufacturer's instructions when adding chlorine bleach to water.
- Check the ammonia level with the test kit. You can use a test strip or take a water sample to test. When you first use a chlorine bleach, the ammonia level measured in the aquarium water will be zero. You should measure your ammonia level once a day until it starts to appear. This will let you know how long it takes to change the water in the tank. [19]

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-15-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Water exchange and water treatment. 

Change the water in your tank twice a week to make sure ammonia, nitrate, and nitrite don't build up to dangerous levels. You can use distilled, bottled or tap water, but all types of water must be treated before being added to the tank to restore the nutritional balance in the water. [20]
- Change 25% -50% of the water in the tank twice a week, ie add 25% new water and retain 75% of the old water (or 50% new water and 50% old water).
- Use an aquarium water treatment agent to adjust the pH of the water. Use the product according to the manufacturer's instructions.
- Mix 1 tablespoon aquarium salt and 1 drop of an antifungal like Aquarisol for every 4 liters of water. Table salt may contain additives such as iodine and calcium silicate that are toxic to fish.

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-16-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Cycle nitrogen in the aquarium.

Nitrogen cycling is the process of building up beneficial bacteria in an aquarium to help the fish grow well. These bacteria will help keep ammonia levels low by breaking down fish waste into nitrite and then into nitrate. You should begin cycling with a new tank and not stocked. [21]
- Provide a source of ammonia to initiate the production of beneficial bacteria in nitrates. You can add fish food or ammonia solution to the tank. Use the test kit to check for ammonia, nitrite and nitrate in the water. The initially measured ammonia level will be zero.
- Test the water daily to monitor ammonia. Ammonia levels will then decrease when nitrite begins to appear, and nitrite levels will decrease as nitrate levels increase.
- Add a little fish flakes to the water to maintain ammonia formation, which in turn forms nitrite and nitrate.
- Please be patient. Proper nitrogen cycling in an aquarium can take four to six weeks to reach the right chemical levels. Improved water quality will help fish stay healthy and live longer.

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-17-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Air conditioning water. 

The water temperature in the aquarium should be between 24-26 degrees Celsius. You should use a 25 W aquarium heater to keep the temperature in the tank. Aquarium heaters are available at aquarium stores or on gills for about 200-300 thousand VND. [22]
- Attach thermometer in tank and check occasionally to make sure temperature is stable.
- Place the aquarium in a warm area of ​​the room. The aquarium needs to be kept at a constant temperature. The aquarium placed next to the window can be exposed to cold temperatures which can harm the fighting fish.

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-18-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.6 Use a water filter in the aquarium. 

Install a filter in the aquarium to clean water impurities. You should choose a filter that does not stir the water too much, because the fighting fish do not like dynamic water. Water purifiers are available at aquarium stores for about VND 600,000 - 3 million, depending on the size of the tank. [23]
- Try attaching a bubble to a small pump if you don't want a water purifier. Air bubbles can be found in aquarium shops for about 100-200 thousand.
- Buy a water purifier that matches your tank size.

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-19-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.7 Mix aquarium salt in the water. 

Aquarium salt is a volatile sea salt and is used to reduce the nitrite level in the water, which aids the gill function. Salt also increases the electrolytes that improve the overall health of the fish. [24]
- Mix 1 tablespoon of salt for every 20 liters of water.
- Add aquarium salt to your newly installed aquarium, when changing the water and during the time you are determining your fish's illness.
- Do not use table salt instead of aquarium salt. Table salt may contain additives such as iodine and calcium silicate that can be toxic to fish.

## 4. Disinfect the aquarium

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-20-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Drain the aquarium water completely. 

If you need to isolate your fish, you will also need to disinfect the tank to prevent the disease from spreading to other fish. You should also disinfect the tank before returning the fish to the tank. [25] Empty the tank and remove all contents.

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-21]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-21-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.2 Throw out any plants in the tank. 

These plants are not sterile, so it is best to buy new plants, whether real or fake, for sale at the store.

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-22]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-22-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.3 Handling gravel in an aquarium. 

If there is natural gravel on the bottom of the aquarium, remove all the gravel from the tank and bake in a baking tray at 232 degrees C for 1 hour, then let it cool. Do not bake the gravel covered with any of the outside material, as the coating may melt. In this case, it is probably better to throw away the old gravel and buy a new one. [26]

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-23]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-23-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.4 Make a solution of bleach and water. 

Mix 1 part bleach with 9 parts clean tap water in a spray bottle. Use household bleach that does not contain other detergents. Never use bleach while the fish is in the tank, as this will die.
- Spray the bleach solution into the tank. Let stand for 10 - 15 minutes.

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-24]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-24-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.5 Wash the tank several times. 

You need to rinse the bleach thoroughly so that the water won't become contaminated when you return the fish to the tank. Wash several times, then wash one more time for safety. Use a paper towel to dry the tank.

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-25]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-25-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.6 Place all other items in the aquarium (filters, plastic plants, etc.) in a bleach bucket or bowl. 

Soak for about 10 minutes, then rinse several times with water before re-filling.

## 5. Change the habits of feeding fish

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-26]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-26-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 5.1 Give the fighting fish a suitable food. 

Buy fishmeal or shrimp meal pellets. [27] Add a little more blanched beans once a week or feed your fish with fruit flies with their wings on it occasionally. [28]

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-27]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-27-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 5.2 Do not overfeed the fish. 

Siamese fighting fish stomachs are just as small as their eyes, so you should only feed the same amount of food twice a day, that is about 2-3 fish food pellets.
- Soak the pellets in water for about 10 minutes before feeding the fish. This way, the food will not expand in the fish's stomach. [29]
- If you feel that the fish's belly is round after eating it, you are overfeeding the fish. If the fish seems to still have a craving for it, it probably hasn't eaten enough. [30]

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-28]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-28-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 5.3 Clean up any leftovers in the tank. 

Uneaten food becomes toxins in the water, allowing bacteria to grow and increasing ammonia levels. The bacteria in the tank will turn to attack the fish.

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-29]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-29-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 5.4 Fasten the fish once a week. 

If you find your fish has digestive problems or constipation, you can fast once a week. This does not harm the fish and allows the fish to dispose of what was eaten. [thirty first]

## 6. Use medicine to cure fish

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-30]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-30.jpg.webp)

### 6.1 Isolate diseased fish. 

If your fish has an infectious disease, you need to remove the fish from the tank to avoid infecting other fish. Prepare a temporary aquarium for the fish by pouring clean and treated water into the tank. Pick up the fish from the old tank and place it in a new tank.
- If your fish is stressed because of a new fish or the environment in the tank changes, you should see it improve after quarantine.

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-31]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-31.jpg.webp)

### 6.2 Disinfect after handling fish. 

Many fish diseases have a high risk of infection. Anything that touches the fish or comes in contact with water such as your hands, scoop, spoon, etc. must be disinfected before it comes into contact with other fish. Use antibacterial soap to wash your hands. [32]
- Disinfect all other objects that come in contact with the fish or aquarium with the bleach solution (1 part bleach to 9 parts water). Soak everything in bleach solution for about 10 minutes and rinse thoroughly. Rinse again for safety. Never add bleach to the tank while the fish is still in the tank as this can kill the fish.

![Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-32]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-save-the-dying-siamese-fighting-fish/v4-728px-Save-a-Dying-Betta-Fish-Step-32.jpg.webp)

### 6.3 Treat fish with medicine. 

Once the fish disease has been identified, you can use conventional medicine to cure the fish. [33] Choose the medicine for the correct illness and use it according to the manufacturer's instructions.
- Remember to finish the course of treatment as recommended by the manufacturer.
- Consider carefully when using medicine for fish. Don't try multiple medications and guess what works. If in doubt, consult a veterinarian who specializes in aquatic animals.
