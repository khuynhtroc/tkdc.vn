> Bettas are a great choice for a home or office aquarium. This fish is easy to keep, more active than most other fish and also beautiful. [1] Bettas are carnivores, so they will eat meat-based foods. You should not give them dry, plant-based pellets intended for most tropical fish. If you understand the betta fish's diet and feed the fish properly, your fish can live a long time.

## 1. Give the fish the right amount

### 1.1 Feed the fish an amount of food using the ankle bridge. 

Betta fish stomachs are about the size of their eyeballs, and you should not feed your fish more than that amount at once. This is equivalent to 3 feed pellets or 3 saltwater shrimp at a time. If you feed your fish gel food, the amount will be similar. Betta fish can eat once or twice a day. [2]
- It is a good idea to soak dry food (such as pellets) before feeding the fish, as the food will likely swell up in the fish's stomach if swallowed while it is still dry.

### 1.2 Reduce the amount of food if the fish is not finished. 

If your betta has leftovers, you need to reduce the amount of food each time you feed them. If you usually give your child 4 capsules, try cutting them down to 3. If you see them eat up quickly, you can increase it back to 4 capsules.

### 1.3 Remove any food scraps from the tank. 

Uneaten food in the aquarium can bait bacteria, and this is bad for water quality and for the fish. It will be even more troublesome if the fish eats spoiled food pellets.
- Use a small racket that you would normally remove the feces from or transfer the fish to another tank.

### 1.4 Feed regularly. 

Bettas need to be eaten every day or almost every day. Each day you should feed the fish two meals evenly spaced. Don't worry if you keep fish in the office and can't feed them on weekends; they should be fine as long as you feed them every five days a week. Remember to set aside a day for fish to fast. This is good for them. [3]
- Bettas can starve for up to 2 weeks without dying, so don't worry if they don't eat for a few days due to illness or are adapting to a new environment, but of course you should not try to see them starve. how long!

### 1.5 Add a number of different foods. 

In the wild, bettas eat many small prey. Feeding your bettas the same food over a long period of time can damage the fish's immune system and cause them to eat less.
- You can change the food as often as you like. Try to feed your bettas at least one food different from your regular diet at least once a week.

## 2. Choose the right food

### 2.1 Feed the fish with worms. 

In the wild, many types of small waterworms can become the main source of nutrients for bettas. The most common type of betta fish worms are bloodworms, which are sold as live worms, freeze-dried, frozen, or in gel form, but they are not very nutritious, and are best used only as treats. Saltwater shrimp or glassworms (tubeworms) are a good choice, but betta fish pellets or gels are best. [4]
- Live tube worms often carry parasites or bacteria, so you should avoid feeding your fish.
- The best live worms that can be fed to a betta are white worms, pinworms, and thread worms.
- Most aquarium stores sell these worms.

### 2.2 Feed the fish with insects. 

You can use live or frozen insects. The best options are water bugs and fruit flies. [5]
- These insects are available at most pet stores. You can also feed your fish on live, flightless fruit flies, usually in jars and sold as reptile feed. To feed your fish fruit flies, shake the fruit flies into a plastic bag and place them in the freezer for a few minutes to slow them down, then quickly dump the fruit flies into the aquarium. Take out the fruit flies that the fish cannot eat out.

### 2.3 Give the fish other foods. 

There are many types of frozen meats that bettas can also eat. You can use saltwater shrimp, mysis shrimp or frozen beef heart. These foods can be found at most pet stores. [6]
- Beef heart or meats can stain the water with oil and protein in the meat, so you should only eat it sparingly as a reward for the fish.

## 3. Avoid improper feeding

### 3.1 Avoid overusing dry food. 

These foods are scaly or lyophilized. Some foods are said to be for bettas but can still cause digestive problems due to their indigestible fillers and lack of moisture. [7]
- The pellets, when eaten, will absorb water and expand 2-3 times the original size. Some bettas react badly and may develop constipation problems or a fish bubble disorder.

### 3.2 Soak dry pellets in water. 

If dry pellets are the only thing you have, soak them in a glass of water for a few minutes before feeding your betta. The pellets will expand to their full size before the fish is eaten. [8]
- Do not overfeed the fish. Cut back on your diet if you notice bloating. You can switch to raw feed if the fish is constantly bloating.

### 3.3 You should not always follow the instructions on the fish food packaging. 

Many pellets or flakes often say "Give the fish enough for 5 minutes or until the fish stops eating". This is not true of bettas. In the wild, bettas instinctively eat as much as they can because they don't know when there will be next meal.
- Overfeeding the fish can also reduce water quality and make fish obese. [9]

> Advice
- Keep the bettas in a large aquarium (not in a bottle) for easy cleaning of leftovers and waste, and there is also space for the fish to thrive.
- Maintain an interaction with the betta fish to keep it from getting bored and bonding with you.
- Fasting fish every few weeks a day.
- Remember that bettas have a variety of food requirements, so you should feed your fish a variety of nutritious foods. Frozen food is not necessary if not readily available, but sometimes as a reward for the fish is fine.

> Warning
- Bettas should not be fed to wild-caught insects as they can carry disease.
