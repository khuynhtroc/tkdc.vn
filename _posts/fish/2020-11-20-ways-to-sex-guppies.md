> Guppies are popular aquarium fish because they have very eye-catching colors. Although guppies are very easy to eat the newborn babies, they will reproduce very quickly after mating. You can tell the sex of guppies quite easily from body shape, fins and color when they are at least a week old.

## 1. Check your fish's body shape and color

### 1.3 Check if the fish's body is slim or round.

The body shapes of male and female guppies are very different and very characteristic. The male's body is usually elongated, while the female is larger and rounder, sometimes twice as large as the male.
- During pregnancy, the female's body swells up to appear stuffed and even lumpy. The closer you get to the date of birth, the female body will be rounder. [first]
- You can use a magnifying glass to make it easier to observe the fish's body shape, size and color when it is swimming in the tank.

### 1.2 Note the size of the fish. 

You can estimate the size of the fish to determine their sex. Females can be up to 6 cm long and are usually much larger than males. In contrast, males can only be about 3 cm long.

### 1.3 Observe the fish's colorful colors and patterns. 

Male guppies are usually more showy than females; their entire body can be covered in bright colors and patterns. The body and tail of the male have orange, blue, purple, green, black and white spots or markings. These colors will help them to attract females. [2]
- Note that the variety of colors and colorful patterns on the fish's body is not a sure sign of a male. Females of many guppies are also quite colorful, so in addition to color, you will need to rely on some other body characteristics to determine the sex of the fish. [3] You can look up guppies online to see what kind of fish you have and see the different colors and patterns on their tails. [4]

### 1.4 Find the pregnancy spot under the fish's tail. 

When observing the body shape and color of the fish, you should carefully observe whether the fish has spots of pregnancy. The pregnancy dot is a dark colored dot under the abdomen, located near the tail, and only the female can have this dot. Males do not have pregnancy spots. [5]
- The darker and larger the female guppies are when they are pregnant and closer to the date of birth. When you are close to giving birth, you can even see the fry in the mother's womb near the pregnancy spot. After the baby is born, this spot on the mother's belly will be lighter and darken again when pregnant again.

## 2. Observe the fish's fins

### 2.1 Observe the fish's dorsal shape. 

The dorsal fin is on the back, about 5-7.5 cm from the fish head. Males have long dorsal fins that float in the water while swimming. Females have shorter dorsal fins and do not float in water. [6]

### 2.2 Check the shape of the fish's tail fin. 

The caudal fin, or tail, can help determine the sex of your guppies. The male has a broad, long tail with showy color and pattern. Females have a shorter tail, usually not as wide and long as that of the male. [7]

### 2.3 Pay attention to the length and shape of the anal fin. 

The guppies' anal fin is the small fin below the belly of the fish, just before the caudal fin. The anal fins of males are usually long, narrow and slightly pointed. Males use this fin to deliver sperm into the female. [8] [9]
- In contrast, the female's anal fins are shorter and look like a triangle. The female's gestation point is just above the anal fin.
