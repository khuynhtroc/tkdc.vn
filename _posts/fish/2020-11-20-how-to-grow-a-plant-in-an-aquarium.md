> Aquatic plants are a beauty that adorns your home and offers many benefits for aquarium fish. The plants grown in the aquarium will remove nitrates from the water, improve water quality and inhibit algae growth. They also help increase the oxygen levels in the tank and provide a comfortable shelter for the fish. [1] Growing plants in an aquarium is a fun and easy hobby that can be enjoyable for you and your fish as well.

## 1. Choose a suitable aquatic plant

### 1.1 Choose popular, easy-to-grow aquatic plants. 

Freshwater plants have different needs for light and are sometimes difficult to maintain. Luckily, there are a number of easy options for beginners that will add to the beauty you want to see in your aquarium. Look for plants that are labeled Echinoderms, Lilaeopsis, Anarchies, or Anubis.
- The tall plants you can choose from are the lanceolate (Amazon Sword) and the Java fern (Java Fern). The ligule is very easy and quick to plant, helping to obscure the filtration system and the line in the aquarium if the devices are exposed from behind. Java ferns with long leaves can provide good hiding places for fish.
- For medium-sized plants, good options include Nana (Anubias Nana) and seaweed (Dwarf Sagittaria). Nana's Wiper has a curved body and round leaves. They have long green leaves with curved blades and grow well around hard aquarium decorations such as stone statues. [2]

### 1.2 Use moss to decorate the bottom and the front of the tank. 

Easy-to-grow freshwater mosses include Java Moss, Willow Moss and Water Wisteria. Mosses are low-growing plants, so you can plant them in the front of your tank without obscuring other plants. The moss is also growing pretty quickly, so you'll see results soon.
- Moss grows best under moderate to strong light. [3]
- Moss can also be a food for fish. [4] However, you still need to feed the fish. Not all fish eat moss.
- Another great option for the bottom and front of the tank is Dwarf Baby Tears. This lush, leafy tree grows quickly like a moss but has a more shrub-like appearance. Cuban pearl tree does best in strong light. [5]

### 1.3 Buy a mature plant if you want to have a complete aquarium right away. 

A mature tree is usually more expensive, but it's the best way to get the look you want right away. Choose plants that have sprouted and have white roots.
- Check carefully when buying plants to make sure there are no snails, shrimp and algae on the plants. [6]
- Plants are available at an aquarium store or aquarium design store. You can also find them online.
- Find out about the sellers before you buy to make sure they have a reputation for clean, healthy plants.

![Grow-Freshwater-Aquarium-Plants-Step-4]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-grow-a-plant-in-an-aquarium/v4-728px-Grow-Freshwater-Aquarium-Plants-Step-4-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.4 Plant your plants from branches if you want to be less expensive. 

Although it will take longer before you see the results, this will save you money. To grow a plant from a branch, you will need to get a stem from a growing tree, which is commonly available at most aquarium design stores and online. Identify the lowest eye on the branch, then remove the leaves below. Plug the twigs into the tank base to allow the plant to take root. [7]
- You can also get branches from someone you know who have aquariums.

![Grow-Freshwater-Aquarium-Plants-Step-5]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-grow-a-plant-in-an-aquarium/v4-728px-Grow-Freshwater-Aquarium-Plants-Step-5-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.5 A variety of trees of different sizes make for a beautiful view. 

The multiple layers of plants will make your aquarium more attractive. Base plants should be larger, while medium sized plants should be planted in the middle of the tank along the walls. You can decorate the front of the tank with close-up plants such as moss or Cuban pearl tree. [8]
- The size of the aquarium plants can range from as small as 2.5-5 cm to large plants that cover the entire aquarium.
- Add figurines, rocks and logs to animate the aquarium. These are also great places to keep plants that don't need to be plugged into the bottom of the tank.

## 2. Installation of an aquarium

![Grow-Freshwater-Aquarium-Plants-Step-6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-grow-a-plant-in-an-aquarium/v4-728px-Grow-Freshwater-Aquarium-Plants-Step-6-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Purchase and install lamps to facilitate plant growth. 

Like other plants, plants need light to grow. Light is essential for photosynthesis to generate energy and nutrients for plants. You need to check the light needs of each plant, as each plant has different needs. Full-spectrum fluorescent and LED aquarium lights are both good options. Plants can also get more light from nearby windows.
- Many plants require a lot of light, so do some research before choosing. [9]
- You should start with a fluorescent lamp that is 2.5 W for every 4 liters of water, unless you have a carbon dioxide system installed in place.

![Grow-Freshwater-Aquarium-Plants-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-grow-a-plant-in-an-aquarium/v4-728px-Grow-Freshwater-Aquarium-Plants-Step-7-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Isolate and treat newly brought back plants before adding them to your aquarium. 

The new plants can carry pests such as snails or shrimp that can threaten safety in the tank. Snails and shrimps can multiply quickly and fill your tank, unless you have fish that feed on these organisms. [10] In addition, newly acquired plants can introduce bacteria or pathogens into the water. [11] Quarantine will help you spot pests before they have a chance to enter your tank. [12] You can also treat the plant with a bleach solution.
- To treat bleach, you need to mix 1 part bleach with 19 parts water. Depending on the sensitivity of the plant, you can dip the plant in the solution for 2-3 minutes. Rinse the plants thoroughly in water before adding to chlorinated water. [13]
- To prevent snail infestation, you should dip the plant in salt water after you buy it. Mix 1 cup (240 ml) of aquarium salt or kosher salt in 4 liters of water. Soak the plants in the solution for 15-20 seconds, keeping the roots above the water. Make sure to wash the plants thoroughly before adding them to the tank. [14]
- After a week of quarantine, you can place the plants in the tank.

### 2.3 Place plant-friendly substrates on the bottom of the tank and apply gravel on top. 

The substrate is the material used to cover the bottom of the tank. When planting your plant, you will need a nutrient-rich foundation, although this can be a bit more expensive at first. The plant's good substrate also tends to cloud the water when disturbed, but you can prevent it by spreading a thin layer of gravel on top.
- Seachem Flourite contains all the necessary nutrients and comes in a variety of colors.
- Clay and laterite are good options for nutritional supplements and can be less expensive. However, these materials usually take longer to settle in the tank.
- Aqua Soil contains a lot of nutrients for plants, but causes the pH of the water to drop to 7. Although it is an optimal choice for plants, this substrate can be harmful to fish. You need to test your fish's pH needs before choosing this substrate.
- Gravel does not provide nutrients to the plant if used alone. [15]

![Grow-Freshwater-Aquarium-Plants-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-grow-a-plant-in-an-aquarium/v4-728px-Grow-Freshwater-Aquarium-Plants-Step-9-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 Plant plants that need to cling to the substrate to help plants get nutrients. 

Some plants need to be rooted in the substrate to absorb needed nutrients. Place the roots just below the surface of the substrate, but not too deeply, as this can cover the rhizome of the plant, which is the thick green stem above the roots. Plants can die if the rhizomes are buried.
- Make sure not to overlap one tree with another. [16]

![Grow-Freshwater-Aquarium-Plants-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-grow-a-plant-in-an-aquarium/v4-728px-Grow-Freshwater-Aquarium-Plants-Step-10-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.5 Tie the rest of the plants to rocks or wood so that the tree can take root. 

Certain species of plants, such as moss, Java fern, or Nana planthave like to grow on rocks or wood. These trees will then grow roots on rocks or wood. Wrap the fishing line lightly around the tree, then loop the line over the rock or piece of wood. Tie the fishing line tightly, then release the rocks and plants into the tank.
- Driftwood and lava rock are good options for anchoring plants. [17]

![Grow-Freshwater-Aquarium-Plants-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-grow-a-plant-in-an-aquarium/v4-728px-Grow-Freshwater-Aquarium-Plants-Step-11-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.6 Release the fish when the tank has stabilized after a week. 

Wait a week after setting up your aquarium before releasing the fish. If you bought fish, you can put them in the aquarium, but it is best to wait until the tank is ready before buying.
- Fish waste will be a source of fertilizer for the plants. [18]
- Don't be too eager to release the fish too soon. The aquarium needs to go through a process called "microbiology" , in order for the water to be stable and safe for the fish. Very few fish can survive before the water environment stabilizes. [19]

## 3. Take care of aquatic plants

![Grow-Freshwater-Aquarium-Plants-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-grow-a-plant-in-an-aquarium/v4-728px-Grow-Freshwater-Aquarium-Plants-Step-12-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Prune plants that grow beyond the tank to avoid decomposition. 

Most plants grow fast, so pruning is essential. If the plant grows out of the tank the part of the plant outside will die. Use sharp scissors to carefully cut off the excess tree.
- Another way is to choose slow-growing plants. [20]

![Grow-Freshwater-Aquarium-Plants-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-grow-a-plant-in-an-aquarium/v4-728px-Grow-Freshwater-Aquarium-Plants-Step-13-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Clean water weekly to maintain a good environment in the aquarium. 

Unlike fish, aquarium plants do not require frequent water changes, but regular water changes will maintain a healthy environment in the aquarium. The first step is to scrape the algae from the tank walls. Use a siphon to absorb 10-15% of the water, paying special attention to the gravel and the area around the fixtures attached to the aquarium. Add the extracted water with clean and chlorinated water. [21]
- When using a siphon tube, make sure not to place it on the planting floor to avoid accidentally killing the plant. You need to place the tube above the substrate.
- Shrimp and catfish both eat seaweed, so they are good choices to supplement the aquarium, depending on the other fish species chosen. [22]
- This process is also known as water change. Some people like to change the water completely every few months, but this can disturb the ecosystem in the tank. It is better to use a water filter and keep the tank clean.

![Grow-Freshwater-Aquarium-Plants-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-grow-a-plant-in-an-aquarium/v4-728px-Grow-Freshwater-Aquarium-Plants-Step-14-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Add fertilizer to promote healthy and fast growth. 

Aquatic plants usually do not need fertilizer, especially when there are fish in the tank, as their waste can fertilize the plants. However, fertilizer can help the plant grow better and may be worth the extra effort. There are many ways to fertilize aquatic plants:
- You can add fluorite directly to the substrate to provide iron and nutrients to the plant.
- Substrates are placed near the roots and tucked under the substrate. The substrate will continuously provide the plants with nutrients for 2-3 months.
- If you prefer to use water fertilizers, you can add them to the tank once or twice a week. Water fertilizers are suitable for plants that are not rooted in the substrate, such as plants tied to rocks. [23]
- The CO2 pump provides more CO2 for the plants to absorb and convert to oxygen. If you are in an aquarium with strong light, adding more CO2 helps because the light promotes photosynthesis, which means the plant will convert CO2 to oxygen more quickly. [24]

![Grow-Freshwater-Aquarium-Plants-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-grow-a-plant-in-an-aquarium/v4-728px-Grow-Freshwater-Aquarium-Plants-Step-15-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Avoid allowing plants that are not completely submerged to dry out. 

Plants will die when they dry out. To keep the plant healthy, store it in a bucket of clean water. This is a good choice if you are planning on adding more plants to your aquarium. [25]
- You can store the plants in the bucket for a long time if you have clean water and proper lighting. Plants that need to be rooted in the substrate will have to stay submerged in water if they want to preserve them for a long time. You need to change the water weekly when storing plants.

> Advice
- Start planting a little and adding more gradually.
- If you have a problem with algae, you can add a cup of ghost shrimp to your tank so they can eat it. This freshwater shrimp usually gets along well with the tetras and guppies.
- Choose aquatic plants that are compatible with fish, as some fish will eat or destroy plants.

> Warning
- Do not throw plants into rivers or the toilet bowl. Many aquatic plants are non-native and can affect native plants. Instead, let them dry out and throw them in the trash.
- If you have an aquarium shrimp, be aware that they will uproot and eat aquatic plants.
