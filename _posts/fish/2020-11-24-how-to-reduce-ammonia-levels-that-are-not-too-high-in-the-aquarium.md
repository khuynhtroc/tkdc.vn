title: "How to reduce ammonia levels that are not too high in the aquarium"
summary: Ammonia is extremely toxic to fish and other aquatic animals. The safe concentration of ammonia in water is 0 parts per million ppm. As long as this concentration reaches 2 parts per million, the fish in the tank can die. By assessing the water in your tank and making the necessary adjustments, you can reduce the ammonia concentration in the water to a level that is safe for fish to live in.

> Ammonia is extremely toxic to fish and other aquatic animals. The safe concentration of ammonia in water is 0 parts per million (ppm). As long as this concentration reaches 2 parts per million, the fish in the tank can die. [1] By assessing the water in your tank and making the necessary adjustments, you can reduce the ammonia concentration in the water to a level that is safe for fish to live in.

## 1. Reduce the concentration of ammonia in the aquarium

### 1.1 Partially change the water in the tank. 

Partial water changes in your tank are a great and effective way to reduce ammonia levels while keeping the tank clean. You should change some of the water in the tank about once a week or more often depending on the condition of the tank. To check, you can use a fish racket to evenly the substrate in the tank, if there is a lot of dirt emerging then you need to change the water more often. [2]
- Leave the clean water out overnight to reduce the chlorine in the water, or you can treat the water with chlorinated agents.
- Wash your hands well to remove all residues of soap, lotion and other potentially contaminating substances, and then dry them with a clean paper towel.
- Disconnect all electrical equipment near the aquarium to prevent the risk of electric shock. You should only plug in after the water change is done and make sure everything is dry.
- To ensure the quality of the tank, you should change about 30% of the water in the tank. For example, for a tank with a capacity of 38 L, you need to change 11.5 L of water.
- You don't have to move your fish to another tank when you change a part of the water, just be careful not to startle the fish when you put your hands in the tank.
- Shave off the algae growing on the wall of the tank. You can buy a professional algae scraper or simply use an old bank card to do this.
- Use a suction hose to put about 30% of the water in the tank into a bucket or other nearby tank, then slowly fill the tank with clean, dechlorinated water.

### 1.2 Take out all excess organic matter in the tank. 

Rotten organic matter is an important factor causing the ammonia concentration in the tank to rise. You can use a fish racquet to take out all the excess (basically everything except the fish and live plants you want to keep) to reduce and prevent ammonia levels in the tank. tank increased. [3]
- Uneaten food contributes significantly to increasing ammonia concentration in the tank.
- The decomposition of fish waste also increases ammonia concentrations.
- Dead plants or dead fish in the tank will release a sizable amount of ammonia.
- Take care to clean the water filter to avoid the accumulation of organic material being pushed back. However, you should not change the filter pad to avoid imbalance of bacteria in the water.

### 1.3 Reduce the amount of feed and frequency of feeding the fish. 

If the fish does not finish the food, the amount of food remaining in the tank may be the cause of the increased ammonia levels. You can minimize this risk by limiting the amount of leftovers you fish.
- Make sure to provide the fish with enough food. Talk to your veterinarian or fish specialist to find out how much to feed your fish.
- Note that changing fish feeding habits will not reduce the high ammonia concentration in the water; however, this will help prevent ammonia levels from rising after you've changed the water in the tank.

### 1.4 Put probiotics into the water. 

Probiotics often gather at the bottom of the aquarium and help convert ammonia into relatively harmless nitrogen components. [4] If the tank is new or the amount of beneficial bacteria in the tank has been significantly reduced, a phenomenon known to fish experts as "new aquarium syndrome" occurs.
- Some aquarists put probiotics into their tanks by placing an inexpensive fish or two into the tank to take advantage of the probiotics from their waste. If you want to do this, you can place your goldfish in a cold tank, a barb in a warm water tank, or a sea bass in a saltwater tank.
- You can also introduce probiotics into your tank by spreading some gravel from the old tank to the bottom of the new tank.

### 1.5 Reduce the pH of the tank. 

Ammonia exists in two forms: it is not ionized (NH3) or ionized to ammonium (NH4 +). Non-ionized ammonia (NH3) is a form that is harmful to fish and is most often concentrated when the pH in water is alkaline (high on the pH scale).
- Using a pH regulator (purchased from a pet store) is probably the easiest way to lower the pH of your tank.
- Lowering the pH does not remove ammonia, but it will help prevent the harmful effects of it if you cannot change the water immediately.
- One simple way to keep your tank's pH low is to use real gravel as a base layer on the bottom of the tank. A base layer of shredded coral or coral sand will release calcium into the water, causing the pH to rise. [5]

### 1.6 Increase water circulation. 

Ammonia in the form of NH3 is a toxic gas that dissolves much in water. Increased water circulation in the tank will likely help diffuse ammonia from the water into the air.
- Increasing water circulation is not effective in large ponds but can help control ammonia levels in the aquarium.
- You can buy an aeration pump at most pet stores or online.
- If you regularly close the lid of the tank, when aerating to increase water circulation, you should open the lid because ammonia gas needs a way out of the tank to diffuse into the air.

### 1.7 Use neutralizing solution. 

You can use this to temporarily adjust the ammonia concentration in your tank. [6] The neutralizer is available at most pet stores or can be ordered online.
- In fact, the neutralizing solution does not remove ammonia from the water, but only helps neutralize the toxins of ammonia, reducing its harmful effects in the water.
- You will still need to use a biofilter (containing bacteria) to convert ammonia into nitrite and nitrate.

## 2. Determine the cause of the high ammonia concentration in the water

### 2.1 Check tap water. 

It is rare for tap water to have too high an ammonia concentration because most local water supply systems have tested for the concentration of chemicals in the water, such as ammonia, to ensure a safe source of water. used as drinking water. However, you should still check again if you've adjusted everything and the ammonia concentration in the tank has not decreased. [7]
- You can use an aquarium water ammonia test kit to test tap water.
- If you find that tap water has a high concentration of ammonia, talk to your local water supplier.

### 2.2 Check for decomposition in the aquarium. 

Decomposition in an aquarium is one of the biggest causes of high ammonia concentrations. You will probably find a way to solve the problem by examining the types of material in the tank. [8]
- All decomposing organic matter, including aquatic plants and microorganisms, can cause ammonia concentrations to rise when their protein structure is broken down.
- Uneaten food can also cause ammonia concentrations to rise when it disintegrates in the water. [9]
- Quickly remove all excess material from the tank. You need to take care of your tank regularly by changing all or part of the water.

### 2.3 Know that fish release ammonia. 

If you see a lot of fish waste floating in your tank, that could be the cause of the high ammonia levels. Fish waste will slowly decompose, as organic matter decomposes, causing ammonia concentrations in the water to rise. [ten]
- You can control the amount of fish waste by removing visible solid waste from the tank and changing all or part of the tank water regularly.

## 3. Accurate ammonia concentration measurement

### 3.1 Buy ammonia concentration test kit.

You can buy this kit at most pet stores. This kit will help check the full concentration of ammonia (including ammonia and ammonium), however will not distinguish the difference between the concentrations of these two so you may not know the exact extent. toxicity of tank water. [11]
- Usually, if there are fish and bacteria in your tank, you will not be able to measure the ammonia concentration in the water with a test kit.
- If the test kit detects the ammonia concentration and you are sure the tank has beneficial bacteria and no organic matter, the problem may be with the tank filter.

### 3.2 Measure the pH of the water. 

The pH of the tank can directly affect the ammonia concentration in the water. By measuring the pH regularly, you can ensure ammonia concentrations are not at toxic levels. [twelfth]
- The pH of water affects the number of ionized and non-ionized ammonia molecules.
- Besides adjusting the pH, you will still need to treat the water in a different way, as increasing the acidity of the water will not break down existing ammonia molecules.

### 3.3 Check the water at the right time. 

Depending on when you were testing the water in your tank, high ammonia concentration readings may be inaccurate. The best time to test the water is right before feeding the fish when the new feed has not been decomposed. [13]
- Ammonia concentration will reach its highest level about 90 minutes after you feed the fish.
- Testing the water right after the fish is finished eating (and is discharging the residue) can result in inaccurate high ammonia levels.

> Advice
- Make sure you don't keep too many fish in the tank.
- Do not give the fish too much food and be sure to use a good filter for the tank.
- It is a good idea to cycle your new aquarium nitrogen before you release the fish.
