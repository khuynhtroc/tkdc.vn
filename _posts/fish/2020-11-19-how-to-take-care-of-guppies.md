## 1. Create a habitat for the fish

### 1.1 Choose an aquarium. 

The 40-liter aquarium is ideal. You need a tank that is not cramped. For example, if you use a 40 liter aquarium, you should only stock about 5 guppies. This will help you maintain the tank better and keep the fish healthier. [first]
- Some guppies breeders and enthusiasts may think that you do not need to follow this ratio, but if you keep a lot of fish in your tank, you should clean and change the water more often. You should consider this when deciding on the size of your tank and how many guppies you want to keep.

![Care-for-Guppies-Step-2]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-take-care-of-guppies/v4-728px-Care-for-Guppies-Step-2-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 1.2 Dechlorination of aquarium water. 

There are many ways to dechlorinate water. You can open the lid of the tank and let it sit for about a week to let the chlorine evaporate or buy a dechlorinator. It is important to dechlorinate the aquarium water and to be added to the tank later. [2]
- These can be purchased at relatively low cost pet stores. You should also buy a chlorine level meter to make sure there is no chlorine left in the water before you put the fish in the tank. Follow the instructions on the chlorinated product bottle.
- Tap water usually has a certain amount of chlorine. You can use purified water, filtered water, or distilled water that is free of chlorine, but to be safe, you should still test the chlorine level before you put the fish in the tank. [3]
- Try to keep the pH of the aquarium water between 6.8 - 8. Guppies prefer a higher pH, so you should maintain a pH of about 7.5 if you want to add more crushed coral.

### 1.3 Maintain the water temperature between 24-28 degrees Celsius. 

Place a thermometer in the tank to monitor the temperature. If you find you need to heat the water, you can purchase a small heater in the tank. [4]
- If you need to use a heater, be sure to buy the one that's right for the size of the aquarium. For example, if you have a 20 liter tank, you will need a heater with a lower capacity than the one for a 40 liter tank. Ask a staff at a pet store if you don't know which heater is right for you.
- To keep the temperature from getting too high, it is best to avoid placing the tank in the sun. Use a heater if you need to increase the temperature in the water and use artificial light instead of placing a sunny spot. If for some reason the water becomes too warm, remove the warm water from the tank and replace it with cooler water to gradually lower the temperature in the water.

### 1.4 Use a water filtration system. 

Usually, aquariums are equipped with a filter system. If your aquarium does not have a filtration system, you may need to purchase it separately. The filter will need to be changed once it begins to turn brown, so be careful with this every time you clean the tank. Ceramic filters are good for beneficial bacteria, making the aquarium clean and healthy for the fish, so you should only change it half at a time to prevent these bacteria from being eliminated all at once. [5]
- Even if your tank has a built-in filter, you can always replace it with a different or better one if you feel the need. Make sure the filtration system can handle the quantity of fish and the size of the aquarium.
- A conventional filtration system is enough to provide oxygen to your tank, but you can still use an extra effervescent tip to help add oxygen to the water if you have a large tank or have lots of fish.
- The aquarium should be installed and operated about 1 month before stocking, so don't be tempted to buy fish before that time. The probiotics present in the filter help to clean the water-soluble toxins, because the water will be polluted by fish waste. These substances cannot be removed by the mechanical system of the filter; only bacteria can process and significantly reduce the toxicity of highly toxic substances. You can do this by doing partial water changes weekly. During this month, feed the bacteria a little fish food (add 1 piece of food every 3 days) to help the bacteria get used to when you put the fish in the tank. This process is called microbiology.

### 1.5 Add plants to your aquarium and decorate your tank. 

Start at the bottom of the tank - gravel the ground at the bottom of the tank. Stone or gravel are a great choice for guppies. Next you should add more plants. You should use real plants, as in addition to bacteria, aquatic plants also play an important role in handling toxins. Another important factor is that the fish have a place to hide, as guppies often exhibit this behavior. [6]
- Be sure to wash off gravel and any decorations before adding them to the tank. Make sure you wash off any dust that might get on it when you display it in the store.
- Avoid adding other natural objects such as shells, roots, sand, as they can contain parasites or alter the pH (or generally harden the water if you put limestone in the water). This can make the fish sick and even kill the fish. It is better to buy these at a pet store to avoid unexpected breakdowns. Only people with experience in keeping fish can bring out natural objects into the aquarium, as they can distinguish which roots and rocks are toxic and which are not (they have to research and gather information first. ).

### 1.6 Install lights for the aquarium. 

Ideally, guppies should have 8 hours a day in the dark. A period of more or less than this level can deform the fish as they mature. You can install a light above the aquarium and set a timing to ensure your guppies have the right amount of light each day, or you can turn the lights on and off every morning and every night. [7]
- If you are using natural light, such as near a window or a light source, make sure the light does not affect the water temperature too much. Remember to maintain the right temperature for your guppies. However, this can lead to algae problem, so it's better to use artificial light.

## 2. Feed the guppies

![Care-for-Guppies-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-take-care-of-guppies/v4-728px-Care-for-Guppies-Step-7-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Give the fish the right kind of food. 

You can feed your guppies any kind of food, both dry and wet, raw or frozen. You can buy ready-made guppies for your guppies with a well-balanced diet, but be sure not only to feed them high-protein foods. You should balance protein and vegetable content. [8]
- Saltwater shrimp, earthworm pellets, cordyceps, worms, and larvae are all great choices for guppies.
- Scaly fish feed is a good choice as a main dish of guppies. Read product labels before buying.

![Care-for-Guppies-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-take-care-of-guppies/v4-728px-Care-for-Guppies-Step-8-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Feed the fish a small amount of feed, 2-4 times per day. 

Instead of feeding large amounts of food at once, spread it all day long. Try to change the types of food each time you feed the fish. For example, this time you can feed them raw shrimp, next time feed them with crumbs. [9]
- Be careful not to overfeed the fish. Guppies need to eat all the food within 2 minutes.

![Care-for-Guppies-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-take-care-of-guppies/v4-728px-Care-for-Guppies-Step-9-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Monitor the health of the digestive system of the fish. 

The water in the tank is a good indicator of whether the fish is doing well with their diet. If the water is cloudy or there are algae in the tank, you may have a problem feeding the fish. [ten]
- If your tank water is cloudy, you should reduce the amount of food by 20% for a few days and wait to see if this helps the fish adjust and the water rebalances on its own. If this happens, it is possible that toxins (ammonia and nitrites) skyrocket as you skipped the microbial stage.

## 3. Maintain health for fish

![Care-for-Guppies-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-take-care-of-guppies/v4-728px-Care-for-Guppies-Step-10-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Keep two or three female to one male. 

You should keep lots of guppies in your tank, as they are social fish and like to live in groups. Make sure to keep a female / male ratio of 2: 1, as the males often stress the female and chase the female around the tank. Keeping more females than males can help alleviate this problem. [11]
- If you do not want to spawn, you should separate the male and female fish to keep separately. The guppies lay offspring rather than spawn, so if the guppies mate, you should see the fry.
- Find out more about breeding guppies before doing this.

![Care-for-Guppies-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-take-care-of-guppies/v4-728px-Care-for-Guppies-Step-11-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Clean the tank once a week. 

This step involves replacing about 25% of the water in the tank with fresh, chlorinated water. You will also need to use a straw to reach the bottom of the tank and remove any leftover food or algae that may have grown on the bottom of the tank. [twelfth]
- When cleaning the tank, you should not drain all the water and replace it with a new one. Changing only 25% -40% of the water in the tank will help the fish adapt better. [13]
- The filter can handle most of the dirt on a daily basis, but using a straw (easily available at pet stores) to remove any algae or food from the bottom of the tank will help keep the tank clean. and healthier fish.
- Clean the inside of the aquarium glass if you notice it is dirty. Use a razor blade to scrape off any dirt in the tank, then suck it off. In addition, it is also a good idea to take out any decorations from the aquarium from time to time and rinse it thoroughly to remove any algae and dirt that have accumulated.

![Care-for-Guppies-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-take-care-of-guppies/v4-728px-Care-for-Guppies-Step-12-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Buy a straw at a pet store. 

You can use the device while the fish is still in the tank, but be careful. If you are concerned that your fish will be damaged, you can transfer the fish to a different pot of dechlorinated water during cleaning.

![Care-for-Guppies-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-take-care-of-guppies/v4-728px-Care-for-Guppies-Step-13-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Track your guppies for disease. 

Guppies are relatively healthy, but they can sometimes become infected with fungus. This disease usually presents with white spots on the body of the fish, called ich. White spot disease is easily treated with a number of medications that you can buy from pet stores. [14]
- Keep the tank clean and well maintained to reduce the risk of the fish getting sick. If a fish dies, get it out quickly. If an animal shows signs of illness, you need to isolate it in another tank for the duration of treatment to avoid spreading the infection to others.
- Some people recommend adding a little bit of aquarium salt to the water to prevent fungus. If you want to keep other fish in the same tank, make sure they are tolerant of this environment (corydoras, for example, won't). Sea salt and table salt are not suitable for use in aquariums.

> Advice
- While keeping males and females separately is fine, make sure they don't tear each other's fins apart for the first few weeks. This phenomenon usually occurs in males.
- Guppies will usually get along well with most other fish, but you should avoid keeping them with other species of fish that are prone to fighting each other.
- Some fish will bite the guppies or refuse to share their habitat, so choose wisely farmed fish.
- Guppies are very small, so you should separate them from their parents so that they won't be eaten. Use a very tight mesh to cover the filter in the tank if necessary.
- Make sure to keep guppies together with friendly species of fish, as aggressive fish will catch the guppies' fins.
- Guppies can be lonely if you keep only one in your tank. In order for them to have a happy life, you should raise at least two children .

> Warning
- Periodically monitor the pH of the water to ensure the health of the fish.
- Females bought from an aquarium store may have been in contact with males. They can carry the genetic material of the male for a year, so even an aquarium that contains only females can have fry.
