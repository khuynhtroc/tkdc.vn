> Siamese fighting fish (Betta in English), also known as Siamese fighting fish, is a favorite fish for its eye-catching color and soft fluttering fins. However, when you buy Siamese fighting fish at the aquarium store, there are times when you don't know if the fighter is young or old. It is very difficult to determine the exact age of the fish, but we can still estimate a relative relative based on observations and practical experience.

## 1. Determine the age of the fish based on a number of characteristics

### 1.1 Check the size. 

Usually adult Siamese fighting fish are about 7.5 cm long. You can put a gauge against the wall of the tank and measure the length of the fish. If the fish is less than average length, it is not fully mature yet. [first]
- It is difficult to measure the exact length of the Siamese fighting fish. Usually you can estimate the length of the fish by applying a gauge to the glass of the tank. You need to be patient because healthy Siamese fighting fish rarely stand still.

### 1.2 Examine the fish's fins. 

The mature Siamese fighting fish have beautiful fins and are soft. If observed, it could be a sign that the fish is mature. If the fin is small, it is immature or is still a fry. [2]
- Know the sex of the Siamese fighting fish. Females usually do not have long and soft fins like the males.
- Do not confuse natural fins and fish fins damaged by disease.
- Cobblads are inherently fins that appear torn or "torn".
- The fins of the older Siamese fighting fish are often heavily worn out. The tip of the fin may be slightly sore or slightly torn.

### 1.3 Evaluate the color of the fish. 

In general, young Siamese fighting fish usually have a vibrant color, while older fish the color will be a bit pale and dark.
- Note: Siamese fighting fish that are bred to make pets have a variety of colors. However, wild siamese fighters are usually gray or dark colors, and only see a hint of vibrant color when they fight. [3]

## 2. Watch for signs of aging fish

### 2.1 Observe your fish for changes. 

You may notice that the color on the fish's body fades a little every day or even though it is fed regularly, the fish is getting thinner and thinner. These are the signs that the siamese fighting fish is getting old. [4]
- Tip: As the Siamese fighters get older, their backs may also begin to change. The back of the old Siamese fighter is slightly hunched, the young Siamese fighter usually has a flatter back. The hump on the back of the fish is quite round, so do not mistake the fish for spinal disease

### 2.2 Be aware of changes in energy. 

Siamese fighting fish will be less interested in spreading their fins as they get older. After many years, they do not even want to spread their fins.
- At the same time, a healthy adult sardines will swim around with enthusiasm, while old fish often hide behind the plants, decorations in the pool and swim very lazily.
- When feeding the Siamese fighting fish, observe how quickly the fish find food. The old siamese fighting fish will probably swim slowly and miss several times before discovering the food.

### 2.3 Watch for signs of dry ice in the ankle. 

Old Siamese fighting fish eye usually appears "dry bead", it is a blur in the eye. This is normal when the siamese fighting fish is old and the fish will do so whether you keep it in a large tank or keep the water very clean.
- Tip: The black and hard to see fish eye is a sign that it is a healthy adult. [5]
