## 1. Create favorable conditions for goldfish to breed

### 1.1 Plan a long time in advance. 

It will take a long time to create a good breeding environment for goldfish, so you should buy the fish almost a year in advance. The best time to buy is July and August, as goldfish usually breed during the spring. [1] Goldfish need to acclimate to their habitat and reduce stress before the breeding season, so try to plan ahead for quite some time!
- The first thing you need to do (assuming you already have a small aquarium that can hold at least 15 liters of water) is to wash your newly purchased fingerlings. By adding 80 drops of formaldehyde, 6 drops of copper sulfate to your tank, and a small amount of terramycin, you can clean your goldfish and aquarium to keep your tank healthy.

### 1.2 Create a good environment in the aquarium. 

The fish spawning tank should hold at least 75 liters of water. In addition, you should also add a few things needed to create a natural setting in the habitat of the goldfish. Usually these are real or man-made shrubs or long bundles of fibers.
- When the female spawns, they often cling to solid objects. If you want them to breed naturally, you will need a rich green environment. This is not required if you plan to spawn artificially, but plants can increase the quality of life (and act as a great filter) when the fish are not spawning.
- Consider buying fiber bundles for spawning fish. The spawning bundles are made of floating nylon wire that the female can attach to when spawning. [2] You do not need these strands if you have a lot of shrubs, plants, or other fibrous materials in your aquarium, but this is an easy and effective way to protect your goldfish eggs, since goldfish Adults often eat eggs that have no grip.

### 1.3 Begin to raise the diet for goldfish. 

Avoid sudden changes in your fish's diet. Introduce your fish to non-pellet foods like saltwater shrimp or live worms stocking in the tank, mimicking what is in the wild in spring, the goldfish's favorite spawning time. In general, there are two points to keep in mind when feeding goldfish:
- Feed the fish in small amounts but many times. You should feed the fish three times a day, taking care not to overfeed the necessary amount. Many goldfish owners make the mistake of overfeeding their fish; uneaten food crumbs sink to the bottom of the tank, decompose and contaminate the water.
- Regardless of the type of food you use, you will need to grind it to fit the goldfish's mouth.

### 1.4 Simulate springtime by lowering the temperature, then gradually increasing it to make it warmer. 

Goldfish breed in the spring, so you need to reproduce the increase in temperature in the water. First, lower the temperature to between 10 ° C - 12 ° C. Then, when you are ready to breed your fish, gradually increase the temperature 2 ° C daily until it is between 20 ° C - 23 ° C.

### 1.5 Ensure water circulation every day. 

Partial daily water changes are important to the overall health of the fish and in particular stimulate the fish to reproduce. Change about 20% of the water in the tank every day, remember not to override this amount.
- Be sure to add the water treatment solution to the new water. This product neutralizes chemicals harmful to fish as well as removes chlorine and de-chloramine. [3]

## 2. Sexism and goldfish isolation

### 2.1 Know the characteristics of the female goldfish. 

Sexing goldfish is probably the most important task in breeding fish; Obviously, if you put a bunch of males together because you can't tell a male or a female, you won't get any fry. Female goldfish have the following superficial characteristics:
- Observe the shape of the acupuncture point. A acupuncture point is a small hole in the middle of the anus and anal fin, where the fish spawn or ejaculate semen, depending on the fish's sex. [4] Females are round and convex.
- Touch the fish's belly. The belly of the female fish is located between the oars and anal fins, very soft and can be moved.
- Look at pectoral fins. The female's pectoral fins are round and short.
- In general, female goldfish are generally larger and more rounded, while male goldfish are usually longer and more oblong. However, this is not a reliable feature to distinguish.

### 2.2 Know the characteristics of the male goldfish. 

Male goldfish are usually smaller than female goldfish of the same age. They are also often distinguished by the following characteristics:
- The appearance of small white spots, also known as nodules. These are small nodules on the fins, head and even gills of the fish as they reach spawning.
- Concave point. The male goldfish has a concave point instead of a protrusion.
- Touch the fish's belly. The belly of the male fish is stiffer and firmer than the belly of the female.
- Look at pectoral fins. The pectoral fins of males are more pointed and longer than the pectoral fins shorter and rounder in females.

### 2.3 Observe the goldfish's behavior to distinguish between males and females. 

During the breeding season, the male begins to chase the female, slowly at first, gradually becoming more enthusiastic. Try dropping a goldfish you already know as a female into the tank and observe the other fish's reactions: Male goldfish show great concern, while females are completely indifferent!

### 2.4 Consider isolating the male and female fish for several weeks before you allow them to breed. 

Many breeders separate males and females at least a few weeks before breeding to stimulate their desire. Like humans, the further away the more desirable!

## 3. Breeding goldfish

### 3.1 Choose good broodstock. 

Healthy young fish are ideal, as they are fertile and full of energy. Choose female fish with large tail and pectoral fins; For males, look for large ones (about 10-15 cm long) and swim fast. Males with many post-head nodules on the gills are good breeders.
- For the best combination, try to isolate the best three males and two females.

### 3.2 Drop five goldfish in the same tank and watch for spawning naturally. 

You will notice that the male gold patch will have a lighter color in the abdomen and swim quickly around the tank, often chasing the female. The female will lay eggs on a green plant in the tank, and the male will release semen on the eggs to fertilize. If you have not seen fertilization but did see eggs in the plant, it is more likely that the eggs have been fertilized.

### 3.3 If the natural spawning process of the goldfish has not been successful, you will need to artificially inseminate the fish. 

Put one female and one male in a shallow tank. Pick up the male fish and gently strok its hole to release semen. Stir the semen in water and repeat this with the female to squeeze the eggs out. Stir the water again to combine the eggs and sperm.
- Be very careful when artificial insemination. Goldfish are very easy to bruise, so you must be very gentle when handling.
- You do not need to keep the fish underwater while clawing the fish hole. Like other fish, goldfish can breathe even out of the water, although not very well. Just be careful not to let the fish out of the water for more than 30 seconds at a time.

### 3.4 Separate the broodstock from the eggs. 

Unfortunately, captive goldfish often eat most of their eggs, so you will need to separate the broodstock from the eggs almost immediately to ensure that the whole batch is fully hatched. The fertilized eggs will hatch in about 4-7 days, depending on the temperature of the water.
- Once the fry are hatched, you can feed them the same adult food, but make sure the food is smaller than the adult fish for them to swallow.
- Try to put the eggs in the tank the fish spawned. There is a risk if you move the eggs elsewhere.

### 3.5 Be patient while the fish is growing and reaching maturity. 

Soon you will have a whole school of goldfish swimming around the pool. Make sure the tank is large enough to accommodate the fry.

> Warning
- Do not pick up the goldfish unless it is necessary. This not only stresses the fish but can also damage the scales.
