## 1. Choose fish

### 1.1 Choose a healthy fish. 

You should buy fish from a store or vendor that takes good care of the fish. Sometimes it is difficult to know the condition of the fish before you buy it. You may not know how old it is or if you have any illnesses. Betta fish in the aquarium shop can get stressed, sick and live in a poor hygienic environment. [1] These factors may contribute to premature death of fish.
- Healthy fish will be more active than unhealthy ones.
- Watch for signs of damage on the fish's body.
- Look for discolored spots that may be a sign of the disease. Note that some Betta breeds have natural spotting.

### 1.2 Buy blue bettas. 

This is because the popular diet for Betta fish contains compounds that make the red bettas even redder, but they are known to increase disease prevention in blue bettas. These compounds, called carotenoids (orange like carrots), are responsible for increasing the orange, red and yellow pigments in bettas. Blue Bettas have an immune system boost instead of hyperpigmentation. [2] Females are also more likely to prefer blue male Bettas than other males when they consume these pigment enhancers.

### 1.3 Choose young fish. 

Many people do not know the age of the fish when buying. You run the risk of buying an old fish, which will reduce the time you spend in possession of the fish. If you choose a young fish, you are more likely to be able to keep the fish for longer. This may not be all, but smaller fish are usually younger fish. As the Betta gets older, the fins will become longer and their bodies will also get bigger. Even though the bettas vary in size, you will be more likely to buy young fish if you choose smaller sizes. If you want to be sure you can buy young fish, you should contact your breeder. [3]
- Fish that is too young is not good either. They are more susceptible to shock when released into another environment.

### 1.4 Check the water in the aquarium. 

Observe if the water in the tank is dirty. Pay attention to whether there is a lot of food left in the tank, as this indicates overfed or they are not eating. The above signs indicate that the fish is not well cared for, so the fish's lifespan may be shortened.

### 1.5 Watch for other fish. 

Even if the fish you choose looks healthy, it doesn't mean it's not infected with the fish stock in the store. Fish can catch diseases from other fish if they are kept in the same tank. If the other fish in your tank don't appear to be healthy, then the fish you choose may not be.

![Help-a-Betta-Fish-Live-Longer-Step-6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-help-your-betta-fish-live-longer/v4-728px-Help-a-Betta-Fish-Live-Longer-Step-6.jpg.webp)

### 1.6 Do not buy more than one fish at a time. 

Although you can keep multiple Bettas in the same tank, each has a slightly different personality. To ensure the safety of your bettas, you should keep only one betta in your tank and do not buy more fish unless you have studied carefully.

## 2. Installation of the aquarium

![Help-a-Betta-Fish-Live-Longer-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-help-your-betta-fish-live-longer/v4-728px-Help-a-Betta-Fish-Live-Longer-Step-7.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Choose an aquarium of the right size. 

Although many claim that bettas still live happily in very small puddles, this fish actually prefers water 30-60 cm deep, similar to the rice fields in which they normally live in the wild. You should choose an aquarium with a minimum capacity of 8 liters so that your bettas have enough space to swim comfortably. In general, an aquarium smaller than 8 liters is not large enough. [4]

### 2.2 Planting aquatic plants. 

Aquatic plants are a great element in an aquarium. Many people choose fake plants because they are easy to maintain, but real plants can improve the water quality in the tank by filtering water and increasing oxygen, even though they require more care. Whether you choose a fake or a real tree, it's important to avoid plants that are too hard or with a sharp surface. These plants can damage delicate fish fins. Here are some plants that are safe for bettas.
- Silk tree
- Java fern
- Christmas moss tree

### 2.3 Fill the tank with clean water. 

This is one of the most important factors when installing an aquarium. Running tap water directly into the tank can kill fish. Chemicals like chlorine and fluoxetine as well as many others in tap water are toxic to fish.[5]They can cause significant harm to the betta fish and reduce the longevity of the fish. You will need to buy a water regulator to fill the tank with water before you add the fish. You may need to wait a few days for the water to settle for enough dissolved oxygen for the fish to breathe.

![Help-a-Betta-Fish-Live-Longer-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-help-your-betta-fish-live-longer/v4-728px-Help-a-Betta-Fish-Live-Longer-Step-10.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 Warm the water in the aquarium. 

The water coming out of the tap is usually not at the right temperature for the fish. As a fish native to Southeast Asia, the Betta likes to live in warm water. The ideal temperature in the aquarium is between 22-26.5 degrees Celsius. You may need to purchase a heater and thermometer to create a healthy environment for your fish. [6]
- Warm water will make your fish more active and maintain the overall health of the fish.
- Fish can die if the water is too cold.
- When you first set up your aquarium, you will need to pre-heat the water and maintain it for 1 or 2 days before you put the fish in.
- Also, when you put your fish in your tank, keep in mind that the water in the tank should be about the same temperature as the water the fish is living in. You can place the fish water bag or fish box in the tank until the water is about the same temperature as the tank water. This way the fish will not be shocked by the sudden changes in temperature that can kill the fish.

### 2.5 Choose "good friends" for the betta fish. 

You cannot keep a Betta with any fish because they have an aggressive nature. Two male bettas in the tank can fight to death. Females can live together but can also hurt each other. Many people choose to keep Bettas in separate tanks, but if you want to keep your Bettas with other fish in harmony, you must choose the right fish like [7]
- Neon tetra fish (in groups)
- Fish cleaning glass bristlenose plecostomus
- Glass fish

## 3. Daily care

![Help-a-Betta-Fish-Live-Longer-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-help-your-betta-fish-live-longer/v4-728px-Help-a-Betta-Fish-Live-Longer-Step-12.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Make a routine fish care schedule. 

Without daily care, your fish will die prematurely. Don't forget that fish cannot tell you when they are hungry or when the water is dirty. To maximize the life of your fish, you need to take regular care of the fish. By being a routine, you will keep this job.

![Help-a-Betta-Fish-Live-Longer-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-help-your-betta-fish-live-longer/v4-728px-Help-a-Betta-Fish-Live-Longer-Step-13.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Feed the fish properly. 

You need to feed your fish regularly and choose the right foods for your fish. Many stores offer betta-specific food, but even then you should check the ingredients. Avoid foods that are primarily fishmeal.
- Many bettas do not like flakes.
- Betta fish pellets are available at most aquarium stores.
- Sublimation dried or frozen foods such as worms or saltwater shrimp are a great addition to the betta fish pellets.
- Feed the fish live food if possible. Research has demonstrated that formulated foods such as store-bought dry foods can have a significant impact on betta fish's health by over 25% of the diet. [8] Few bettas are given a preference for always eating raw food. Although it can be expensive and time consuming, raw food is very beneficial for the betta fish's health.
- Buy an auto feeder when you are away from home for many days so the fish will not starve.

### 3.3 Clean water. 

From time to time, you need to change the aquarium water. This depends on the size of the tank as well as whether the tank has filters or not and whether there are live plants in the tank. You can purchase a test kit to test the water. This way fish will be guaranteed to live in a clean and healthy water environment to prolong their life.

![Help-a-Betta-Fish-Live-Longer-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-help-your-betta-fish-live-longer/v4-728px-Help-a-Betta-Fish-Live-Longer-Step-15.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Clean the aquarium.

Algae can multiply on the walls of the tank, and you need to be cleaned to ensure water quality and to see the fish better. Sand or decorative rock at the bottom of the tank also needs cleaning and must be replaced from time to time. The waste that accumulates on the bottom of the tank can make the fish sick and kill the fish. A water filter can help, but even if you use a water filter, you'll still need to suck the waste from the bottom of the tank.
- Buy a siphon to draw waste and water in the tank into the bucket.
- Buy a set of aquarium glass cleaning magnets or a fish tank brush with a long handle so you won't get wet when cleaning the algae.
- Do not use soap to wash the tank. Simply scrubbing (without using chemicals or soap) is enough to clean the tank.

### 3.5 Play with fish. 

Due to the typical aggressive behavior of a betta fish, many people prefer to use a mirror to lure the fighter to puff in front of the mirror. Although this can cause the fish to be stressful, if you only play like that once in a while, it won't harm the fish. Research has shown that although bettas win a fight that consumes more oxygen, this has no significant consequences. [9] Putting your bettas in a mirror can help them get active and reduce their aggression with other fish. [ten]

## 4. Address any potential fish health risks

![Help-a-Betta-Fish-Live-Longer-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-help-your-betta-fish-live-longer/v4-728px-Help-a-Betta-Fish-Live-Longer-Step-17.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Check for signs of disease in fish. 

Sometimes you can easily tell the condition of the fish just by observing them. Take the time to check it from time to time to make sure the fish appears healthy. This way you will avoid seeing your fish get sick. Some signs of fish to watch for include: [11]
- Anorexia
- Brush yourself against rocks or plants in the tank
- Lie on the bottom of the tank
- Swim on back or tilt
- White feces
- Silver color
- White spots appear

### 4.2 Water sampling. 

Water samples can be analyzed with test kits purchased online or at aquariums. You can also take the water sample to the aquarium store to have it examined by a specialist. Water analysis is one of the best ways to determine the nature of fish diseases. It can tell you about imbalances in the water and cause fish health problems. [twelfth]

![Help-a-Betta-Fish-Live-Longer-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-help-your-betta-fish-live-longer/v4-728px-Help-a-Betta-Fish-Live-Longer-Step-19.jpg.webp)

### 4.3 Maintain water in the tank at a temperature of 26.5 degrees. 

If the water is too cold, your fish can become infected. 26.5 degrees C is the optimal temperature for bettas and can prevent many diseases. This factor may help slow the cycle of certain diseases such as white spots, [13] while also boosting the fish's immune system.

![Help-a-Betta-Fish-Live-Longer-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-help-your-betta-fish-live-longer/v4-728px-Help-a-Betta-Fish-Live-Longer-Step-20.jpg.webp)

### 4.4 Clean water and aquarium. 

No wonder, if your fish is sick, chances are the water in the tank is also contaminated with germs. You need to pay attention to clean water, wash gravel and scour the tank walls when the fish is sick. Don't use soap, as cleaning agents can kill fish. [14]

![Help-a-Betta-Fish-Live-Longer-Step-21]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-help-your-betta-fish-live-longer/v4-728px-Help-a-Betta-Fish-Live-Longer-Step-21.jpg.webp)

### 4.5 Isolate the betta fish from other fish that are sick or could injure them. 

Like all animals, fish can not only injure or injure other fish, they can also infect each other. In this case, the isolation of the fish is important. You may need to have a small quarantine tank ready.

> Warning
- Do not use ice or shells not purchased from the aquarium store in your tank, as this can affect the water quality and kill the fish.
