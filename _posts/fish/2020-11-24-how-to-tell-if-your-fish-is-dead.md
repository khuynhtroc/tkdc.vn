title: "How to tell if your fish is dead"
summary: You see your fish float in the tank or jump out of the tank. Your first reaction may be to grieve or begin to process the dead fish, but the fish is probably alive. Either way, take measures to identify by examining fish's vital signs, handling dead or dying fish, and looking for other problems in apparently dead fish.

## 1. Check for vital signs of fish

### 1.1 Use a racket to pick up the fish. 

Look for signs of resistance when the racquet surrounds the fish's body. If your fish is just sleeping, they will wake up and try to wiggle out of the net. If the fish is immobile, it may be dead or seriously ill.

### 1.2 Detect your breath. 

Check the fish gills. If they don't move, the fish stops breathing. Betta (fighting fish) and choke fish usually breathe through their mouth. If your fish falls into this category, watch for the up and down movements of the fish. [first]

### 1.3 Check your ankle. 

Look into your eyes. If the eye is sunk in, the fish is dead or about to die. A cloudy pupil is also a sign of death in most aquarium fish. [2]
- If your fish is a puffer fish, a sea bass, a discus or a bonnet, sometimes cloudy eyes can be normal. However, you should contact your veterinarian if the turbidity persists for several days. [3]

### 1.4 Check for fish scales. 

Do this if the fish jumps out of the tank. Look for skin cracks when picking up the fish. Touch the fish to see if it will dry out again. These signs appear only in dead fish. [4]

## 2. Handling dead or dying fish

### 2.1 Spend time with the dying fish. 

Look for symptoms like inability to eat or sink right after swimming. It will be quite sad, but you should treat the fish like any other pet. Sit by the aquarium, talk to the fish, if that's what you normally do.

### 2.2 "Rescue" for a fish in pain. 

Clove oil is the most tranquilizer and the most humane way to stop the suffering of a dying fish. You can get it at most drug stores. Just put the dying fish in 1 liter of water. Add 400 mg of clove oil to the water. Within 10 minutes, the fish will lose oxygen and die peacefully. [5]

### 2.3 Remove dead fish from the tank, if possible. 

Use a racket to pick up fish carcasses. If you can't find the body, don't worry. Dead fish will not harm other fish and decompose naturally.
- Fish diseases and parasites require a living host. If you think your fish is sick and dies, then the rest of the fish may also be infected. Watch for symptoms on them. If they do not get sick or their symptoms appear after a few days, they are healthy enough to fight the epidemic. [6]

### 2.4 Do not flush fish into the toilet bowl. 

Released fish carcasses can harm marine species. Dispose of carcasses in a trash can or bury them outdoors. If the fish are large in size, it is best to bury them. Check with local laws to make sure you are allowed to bury an aquarium fish. [7]

## 3. Consider other issues

### 3.1 Treat constipation with peas. 

Constipation will cause the fish to float on the water. Peas (or any type) contain enough fiber to help the fish get back to normal. If the fish has not had a bowel movement in the past few days, give them two to three fresh beans or thawed beans a day. Crush beans or settle small pieces to the bottom of the aquarium. [8]
- Avoid canned beans, as they contain sodium and spices that can damage fish.
- Soften beans. You can soften the beans by placing them in filtered water and boiling on the stove for about a minute. Remove the beans from the pot and allow to cool. Do not use the microwave, as this can destroy essential nutrients.
- Peel them with your hands to remove them. Make sure to wash your hands first!
- Cut the beans into small pieces. First, cut in half if they don't separate when you peel. Then cut into four parts. If your fish is small, cut the beans into even smaller pieces.

### 3.2 Reduce food intake as needed. 

If the fish is not constipated, they may be overeating. Overeating can cause the fish's stomach to swell and make them float. If the fish has been defecating recently, do not feed them for three to four days. [9]

### 3.3 Research on fish sleep patterns. 

When the fish sleep, they stop moving. For example, Bettas and Goldfish sleep by lying on the bottom of the tank. Do an online search and read books on fish care to learn about your fish's sleeping habits. [ten]
- Look for this information on veterinary websites or at your local veterinary clinic. Visit public libraries or pet stores to see books with lots of useful information. If you have access to scholarly databases, search for articles in veterinary journals.
- Some fish like to fake death just to see you panic. Remember to double-check.

### 3.4 Water condition in the aquarium. 

The chlorine, chloramine and heavy metals in tap water can cause illness and death of fish. Add the dehydrating solution to the aquarium, following the instructions on the package. You can purchase a dehydrating solution at your local pet store. [11]
- Check the chlorine, chloramine and heavy metals concentrations in the tank water before adding the dehydrating solution. You can buy test kits at your local pet store. Follow package directions to avoid inaccurate diagnosis of results.
- Alternatively, you can buy distilled water from your local grocery store and use it in the aquarium instead of tap water.

### 3.5 Check the water temperature. 

If you have just changed the water, any sudden changes in temperature could shock the fish. Measure the temperature with a thermometer used for the aquarium. If the temperature is higher or lower than the ideal range for the fish, adjust the thermostat on the aquarium heater. [twelfth]
- Monitor fish to ensure it returns to normal once it has stabilized its temperature.
- In the future, be patient to change the water little by little to avoid sudden changes in temperature or pH.
- If you need a large amount of water change, remove the fish from the tank before changing the water. Place the fish (and their water) in a plastic bag and then put the bag in the tank so the fish will gradually acclimate to the new temperature.

> Warning
- Don't remove fish from the tank unless you are sure they are dead. Most animals cannot survive on land for too long.
