> Many people want to know whether their goldfish are male or female. You may want to identify this for breeding purposes or just to name your fish correct for its gender. Luckily, you can determine whether the fish you're keeping is male or female based on its physical characteristics and behavioral cues.

## 1. Get to know the female

### 1.1 Observe the female's plump body. 

Females usually have a round body and thicker than males of the same age and age.
- Females also have a larger spine-to-belly distance, making it easier to determine the sex of the fish when looking at an angle.
- As the breeding season approaches, eggs will begin to develop in the female's body; This may cause one side of the fish to swell and appear asymmetrical, or one side to sag. [first]

### 1.2 Observe the protrusion point in the female. 

The female goldfish's spot (anus hole) is rounder than the male and is usually slightly raised when the breeding season is approaching.
- When viewed from a side, the female's acupuncture point may appear as a bulging face from the fish's belly.
- In addition to signs of protruding acupuncture points, females also have thicker anal fins than males. [2]

## 2. Identify males

### 2.1 Look for nodules. 

One of the hallmarks of a male fish is the development of nodules (small white spots) on their gills.
- Usually spawning nodules will appear only during the fish's breeding season . However, in older male fish that have lived through many breeding seasons, the nodules can persist year round.
- Nodules may also appear on the pectoral fins, on the face or on the scales of the fish.
- Note that while the appearance of nodules is a reliable indicator of whether a goldfish is male, a fish without nodules is not necessarily a female, since it is not a fish. All male fish have nodules. [3]

### 2.2 Observe the male fish's slimmer and more streamlined body. 

Males are generally longer, thinner and more oblong than females of the same species and age.

### 2.3 Observe the indentation point in the male. 

The spot of the male goldfish is usually narrow and long like an egg. The male's pit is also concave instead of protruding.

### 2.4 Find the line between the abdomen. 


If you can, look under the belly of the fish for a line in the middle: a floating line, running from the back of the ventral fins to the point. In females this line is very blurred or absent.

### 2.5 Watch for chasing behavior.

One of the most reliable ways to identify male goldfish is to observe their behavior during the spawning season.
- The male goldfish will chase the female around the tank or aquarium, swimming close behind and slightly lower than the female, sometimes hitting the female's tail.
- The male will try to force the female against the wall of the tank or plants in the tank to force the female to spawn.
- However, male goldfish also chase each other around even though they do not have female fish, so you should observe body and behavior indicators to determine their sex. [4]

## 3. Understand the difficulties

### 3.1 Know that sex differences will only appear when the goldfish reach adulthood. 

Male and female goldfish will only have distinctly different features as an adult, usually when the fish is one year old.
- However, the maturity level of goldfish will depend on species and sex. For some fish breeds, males reach adulthood by 9 months of age, while for some females it can take up to 3 years to mature.
- Without using the method of DNA analysis, sex determination of the young goldfish is practically impossible. If you want to increase your chances of having both males and females, it's best to buy at least 6 healthy fish of the same breed. According to statistics, the probability of having at least one fish of the opposite sex with the rest reaches 98%. [4]

### 3.2 Know that there is no sure way to sex goldfish other than by observing their reproduction. 

Identifying exactly male or female fish is difficult, even experts sometimes confuse. This is because there are many exceptions:
-  Some male goldfish do not develop nodules. On the contrary, in rare cases, females have these nodules. Some females do not have protruding points, but sometimes males do.
-  Additionally, some varieties of goldfish do not follow this rule - for example, some varieties of goldfish (such as ranchu or ryukin) have a thick, naturally rounded body that makes sex determination by the form of fish is impossible.

![Tell-if-Your-Goldfish-Is-a-Male-or-Female-Step-9Bullet2]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/fishs/how-to-distinguish-male-and-female-goldfish/v4-728px-Tell-if-Your-Goldfish-Is-a-Male-or-Female-Step-9Bullet2.jpg.jpg.webp)

- For the above reasons, it is best to determine the sex of your goldfish by observing multiple signals rather than just relying on one.

### 3.3 Understand that these methods are only true for healthy and well-fed goldfish. 

Unhealthy fish may not have normal reproductive behaviors or normal bodily traits that denote sex. Therefore, it is important to ensure your goldfish is in good health (including good quality water and food) before determining the sex of the fish.
- For example, unhealthy male goldfish may not develop nodules during the breeding season, while unhealthy female fish may not have protruding spots.
- The shape of the fish can also be confusing. A thin-bodied goldfish may be mistaken for a male (as the male is usually smaller), but it is possible that it is a malnourished female. On the other hand, you may think a fish with a swollen belly is female, but that is a sign of edema (an internal bacterial infection). [4]

> Advice
- Some goldfish enthusiasts also believe that males are generally brighter and more active than females.
- Try going to aquarium stores to see larger goldfish. This can help you learn to differentiate them more easily.
