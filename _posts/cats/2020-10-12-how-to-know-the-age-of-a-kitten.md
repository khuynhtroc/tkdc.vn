title: "How to know the age of a kitten?"
summary: If you've just found or just adopted or inherited a kitten from someone else, you probably need to know its age. Cats grow much faster than humans, and the needs of a two-week-old kitten will differ from a six-week-old kitten. It is not possible to know the exact age of your cat, but a good approximation will help you to properly care for this little friend.

## 1.	Examine your cat's physical features

### 1.1. Find the umbilical cord

If you see the cat's cord stump, you can be sure that the cat has just been born.
- Mother cats often bite off the umbilical cord when giving birth. The other umbilical cord will be a small piece of tissue under the kitten's abdomen.
- A kitten's cord stump usually falls off within the first three days of giving birth. If your cat still has an umbilical cord, it is probably only a few days old.

### 1.2. Observe the cat's eyes

Your cat's eyes will go through a variety of developmental stages from when a cat is born to opening and eventually change eye color. Watching and monitoring your cat's eye color change can help you guess its age.
- Cats usually don't open their eyes until 10-14 days of age, but some may open their eyes early, between 7-10 days old. If your cat remains closed, it has only been born a few days. If the cat's eyes were open, he was probably at least a week old.
- If your cat has opened her eyes but is still baby, it is likely in the second or third week of life. A cat's eyes are usually blue when opened, regardless of what color they will turn into when they get older.
- If the cat is a bit older and you notice that its eye color is starting to change, it is probably around 6-7 weeks old. By this point, the irises in the cat's eyes begin to change into their true eye color as adults. Note that you may not notice any change in your cat's eye color if you are an adult with blue eye color.

### 1.3. Examine your cat's ears

Similar to a cat's eyes, cats' ears change during the early stages of development. You can guess at what age the kitten is based on the characteristics or variation in her ears.
- If the cat's ears are still close to the head, it may be less than a week old. Newborn kittens have a closed ear canal, so their ears are pressed against the head. Cat ears will start to open when they are 5-8 days old.
- Watch as the cat's ears stand up. The cat's ears open more slowly than the cat's eyes. Although the cat's ear canal will start to open in about 5-8 days, it may take a while for her ears to build. You should see this in the second or third week of life.

### 1.4. Examine the kitten's teeth

A good way to determine a kitten's age is to check for the appearance and development of the cat's teeth. A cat without teeth means a cat is newborn, perhaps less than two weeks old. If your cat has teeth, you can still estimate its age based on the number and characteristics of the teeth.
- The kitten's baby teeth will crack out of the gums when the kitten is about 2-3 weeks old. The first teeth to emerge are usually the incisors. If you can't see the cat's teeth, you may be able to feel it by gently touching the cat's gums.
- Your cat's temporary fangs will grow by the time the cat is 3-4 weeks old. These teeth are long and pointed, growing next to the incisors.
- The temporary premolars begin to emerge from the gums in about 4-6 weeks. The premolars grow between the canines and molars.
- If the cat already has all the teeth except for the molars, it is probably about 4 months old. The cat will then have:<br>
-- 6 upper premolars and 6 lower incisors<br>
-- 2 upper molars and 2 lower canines (next to the last two incisors)<br>
-- 3 premolars on the front teeth<br>
-- 2 lower premolars

### 1.5. Check your cat's permanent teeth

If you see the cat's large permanent teeth, it means the cat is 4 months old or older. The time to develop teeth when a cat is relatively large may be less accurate than when a cat is very young, but you can guess the cat's age quite correctly based on when the permanent teeth appear.
- Permanent front teeth will appear when the cat is about 4 months old.
- At about 4-6 months, the canines, premolars, and molars are replaced with permanent teeth.
- If you already have enough permanent teeth and four molars, your cat is probably at least 7 months old.
- Note that the instructions above apply to normal, healthy kittens; Health problems or accidents can cause your cat to lose teeth or slow growth.

### 1.6. Scales the kitten

Estimating a cat's age based on weight may be inaccurate due to differences in cat size and breed, but this is still a factor in providing more information about the relative age of the cat.
- On average, healthy kittens weigh about 100 g at birth and add about 7 g per day. Thus, a normal kitten will weigh 100 - 150 g within the first week of life. (Note that a kitten weighing less than 100 g may be sick or malnourished. You should bring your cat to the veterinarian for a checkup.)
- A normal kitten will weigh between 113-170 g and smaller than an adult's hand at 1-2 weeks of age.
- Most kittens usually weigh 170-225 g by 2-3 weeks of age.
- A kitten weighing 225-450 g maybe 4-5 weeks old.
- Kittens weighing about 680-900 g are usually 7-8 weeks old.
- A cat 3 months old or older on average will gain another 450 g per month until it has a steady weight of about 4.5 kg. Thus, a cat weighing about 1.4 kg is likely to be 3 months old, and a cat weighing 1.8 kg is usually 4 months old. Although this is only a general estimate, it is a good rule to determine the age of a cat over 12 weeks old until it reaches an adult cat's weight of about 4.5 kg.

## 2.	Evaluate your cat's behavior

![Tell-How-Old-a-Kitten-Is-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-know-the-age-of-a-kitten/v4-728px-Tell-How-Old-a-Kitten-Is-Step-7-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.1. Watch for signs of your kitten weaning

This step only applies to kittens that are still with their mother. The mother will stop breastfeeding when the kittens are 4-6 weeks after birth. That is also the time when the mother cat starts to dry up.
- If the mother cat has completely stopped breastfeeding, the kitten is probably about 7 weeks old. After 7 weeks, the mother cat will no longer breastfeed. You may find that the kittens try to come and suck, but they will be pushed away by their mother.
- Kittens 7-8 weeks old begin to leave the mother more often and for longer periods of time to explore around more.

### 2.1. Observe the kitten's movements

The ability of a kitten to walk steadily can reveal its age based on normal development. Kittens will not stand and walk steadily until they are 2-4 weeks old. From birth until then, most of the time they snuggle between mothers and siblings and suckle milk. If there is a need to move in the first few weeks, the kitten will crawl, belly close to the ground.
- A kitten's unsteady and unsteady gait indicates that it is about 2 weeks old.
- If your kitten is starting to look steady as it walks, it is probably 3 weeks older.
- From 3-4 weeks of age, the kitten will begin to have upright reflexes, ie the ability to rotate in the air and land with feet.
- By about 4 weeks of age, the kitten will be able to walk more steadily and begin to explore its surroundings. The kitten's curious and mischievous nature will be manifested with its increased mobility. Kittens at this age also begin to show prey-petting behavior
- Kittens that can run are at least 5 weeks old.

### 2.3. Observe the kitten's response to sounds and moving objects

Even though your cat's eyes and ear canal will open in the second or third week of life, these senses are still developing at an early stage. Reaction to external stimuli suggests the kitten is about 3.5 weeks old.

![Tell-How-Old-a-Kitten-Is-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-know-the-age-of-a-kitten/v4-728px-Tell-How-Old-a-Kitten-Is-Step-10-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.4. Evaluate your cat's confidence and mischief

A healthy kitten will begin to feel more confident at 5 or 6 weeks of age. This is largely due to the development of coordination and movement. A kitten of this age will begin to explore its surroundings more fearlessly than a younger kitten will hesitate.
- By about 7-8 weeks of age, the kitten has good coordination and motor ability. It will comfortably run, play, and interact with people and other pets, explore the high space by practicing jumping.

## 3.	Know your cat's sexual maturity

![Tell-How-Old-a-Kitten-Is-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-know-the-age-of-a-kitten/v4-728px-Tell-How-Old-a-Kitten-Is-Step-11-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.1. Look for cat puberty signs

Around 4 months of age, your cat's behavior begins to change due to hormonal changes. Kittens this age will meow loudly at night or try to find a way to escape. These are signs that your kitten is beginning to go through puberty.

![Tell-How-Old-a-Kitten-Is-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-know-the-age-of-a-kitten/v4-728px-Tell-How-Old-a-Kitten-Is-Step-12-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.2. Watch for signs of your cat's sexual developmen

At 4-6 months, your kitten will go through the "teenage" phase. Cats of this age will begin to lose a plump body and begin to look thinner, even as they gain weight.
- Male cats older than 6 months may begin scent-marking (spraying the urine) to attract female cats to mate.
- A female cat can start in heat when she is 4-6 months old. This also includes scent marking, humming, and rolling.

### 3.3. Define the "teenage" stage. 

Cats 7 months or older are considered teenagers, and they will both grow in size and become more sexually mature. Note that females of this age can become pregnant if they are not spayed. With sexual maturity, cats also become more aggressive:
- Cats begin to challenge other cats for dominance at around 6 months of age. Young cats are more likely to bite than young and adult cats.
- Bites are common in young cats, so be careful with cats in this age group.

## 4.	Validate your cat's age guess

### 4.1. Ask where you are adopting the cat

Cat stores or cat breeders carefully keep kittens records and at least provide approximate facts. If you haven't seen a kitten, they can still give you an estimate. Even if the animal relief site adopts a kitten when it has been born for a while, there are experienced staff and vet who can estimate the cat's age.

### 4.2. Ask your veterinarian

When you see your cat for the first time, you can ask your doctor to estimate its age. During the wellness visit, your doctor will also advise you on testing and vaccinating your kittens to lead a healthy life.

> Advice
- The period for cats to get used to interactions is when they are 2-7 weeks old. A cat's behavior between the ages of 7-8 weeks is important in determining whether it is happily living with people and other pets. A cat that has not been exposed can become wild and will have difficulty interacting with humans in the future.
