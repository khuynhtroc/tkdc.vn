## 1. Approach an agitated or scared cat

### 1.1 Make sure you and your cat are safe first. 

Approach the cat only when necessary, such as when the cat is checked. Most agitated cats need to be alone rather than cuddled or cuddled. If you must approach the cat, the first thing you need to do is protect yourself, then the anxious cat. A panicked or agitated cat will bite and scratch at its owner. This coercive aggression means that cats are so anxious that they will scratch or bite anyone nearby if they cannot access the object or thing that worries them.
- Approach your cat with care.
- Be careful when approaching cats, wear long clothes.
- Have a towel ready in case you need to catch the cat.

### 1.2 Speak softly and act slowly. 

Talk to your cat calmly. For example, you could say "Calm down Lu, calm down. Shh!" Sit quietly and wait for the cat to calm down, and let the cat know that there is nothing harmful and threatening to him.
- Speak softly and use a low tone of voice.
- Singing has the same calming effect on your cat as when talking in a whisper. Happy songs or slow melodies both work. Do not sing loudly, loudly, or constantly change tones.
- Open a relaxation program on TV.

### 1.3 Lure the cat towards you. 

Feed the cat if it is still unruly. Wet food is often more attractive to cats than dry food and fish has a better flavor than meat.
- Get the cat to climb high to feel safe and able to observe what is going on.
- If possible, stroke the cat's face with your thumb from the bridge of the nose downwards.

### 1.4 Isolate the cat if he is still feeling anxious. 

Move the cat into a closed room, leave it alone, and calm down. Close all the doors to the room where the cat is inside, and lower the curtains so they can't lookout. Take children and other pets out of the room to create a quiet and safe environment for cats to reduce stress.
- To let the cat into a room by himself, cover the cat with a towel, leaving the head. Then place them in a quiet room, such as a bedroom, with a litter box, until they calm down.

## 2. Find a lasting solution for an anxious or stressed cat

### 2.1 Find out what causes your cat's agitation. 

After the problem is over, you need to reassess the situation. What makes cats like that? If this happens once, such as a construction worker in the house, prepare for the next time and put the cat in a quiet room until they leave. If a feral cat is outside, you can try to keep it away, such as spraying water or repellent from the yard.
- If the condition recurs many times (such as moving by car, the arrival of another animal, thunder), you can teach your cat how to cope.

### 2.2 Use pheromones to calm your cat.

Pheromones are substances secreted from glands of the cat's body, including the face, legs, back, and tail, to communicate with other cats. Certain pheromones, such as those released from the face when a cat rubs objects or people, can help calm a stressed cat.
- The scientists synthesized these substances in the form of necklaces, sprays, damp towels, and electric diffusers.

### 2.3 Use other non-medicated sedatives. 

There are many non-medicinal methods that can help calm an anxious or stressed cat. Essential oil or herbal blend can regenerate pheromones and be used as synthetic pheromones. Supplements have also been shown to reduce anxiety in cats. The ingredients in the supplement help support your cat's natural nutrient balance for a relaxing effect. They are available in liquid, chewable and oral form.
- Body wraps (relaxation coats) are another non-medicated soothing method of sedation. This is a patched cloth that can be used to seal the cat's body and put slight pressure on the pressure points to relax her. The principle is similar to wrapping the baby or covering the cat with a towel.
- Not all cats respond well to wrap or pheromone or blend therapy. You need to experiment and find out how your cat reacts to these products.

### 2.4 Consider taking a temporary medication. 

Some cats have certain chemicals in their body that require medication to combat stressful or anxiety-provoking situations. You can give your cat some temporary medication while traveling in the car or meeting other people. There are a variety of medications available to help calm a cat in short-term, temporary situations. These medications require an examination and prescription by your vet to make sure the cat is healthy enough to take the medication.
- Not all cats respond to the same medication, so veterinarians often recommend an initial home drug test to test your cat's response to sedatives.
- Keep in mind that some sedatives need to be taken at least an hour before moving or a stressful situation occurs if the cat is extremely anxious.

### 2.5 Talk to your veterinarian about sedatives for cats. 

There are many sedatives available for cats. They all have side effects and require caution in cats with kidney, heart, and diabetic conditions. Only a veterinarian can recommend the right medication for your cat. Sedatives for cats include:
- Benzodiazepine. Some medications include alprazolam, midazolam, and lorazepam. These are the most common medicines for cats. They work to quickly overcome the fear and anxiety affecting the part of the brain like alcohol does in people. Note: NEVER give alcohol to your cat.
- SARI. Trazodone is a drug that falls into this category. They work to reduce anxiety quickly.
- Clonidine and gabapentin. These two have sedative and anti-anxiety effects in animals, including cats.
- Chlorpheniramine and Benadryl are allergies and cold medications used to calm cats.
- Phenobarbital is another sedative for cats.

### 2.6 Look for long-term treatments. 

There are many long-term solutions for cats that are constantly experiencing anxiety. For cats with extreme stress, a long-term medication approach (taken every day for a few months to a few years) is the best solution to make life more comfortable for cats and their owners. Fortunately, there are now quite safe drugs available that work to overcome chemical imbalances that negatively affect life.
- These drugs include Amitriptyline (an antidepressant for stressed animals), Buspirone Hydrochloride (overcoming phobias, such as fear of a uniform or thunderstorm), Clomipramine (Clomicalm), and Fluoxetine. (Reconcile, Prozac).
- For drugs to work, they need to "accumulate" in the cat's body, so it takes six weeks to determine their effects on pets.
- Also, you should not stop the drug suddenly, otherwise, this will cause a serious effect. The best solution is to gradually reduce the dose of the drug so that the body can adjust accordingly.

> Advice
- Be patient and relax! Cats will tire you out.
- If your cat runs away and lurks, leave it alone to heal itself.
- Sit at a 45-90 degree angle from the cat. This pose is less intimidating and aggressive and helps your cat know she can run away.
- Place the food away from the cat and back so it feels like it can move freely!
- Do not pet an excited cat. Instead, leave them alone until you calm down. After that, you can cuddle and show love.
- Cats can be agitated and angry when bullied and touched often. Take care of the cat-like your own. Love and care for them. Don't be arbitrary, as cats are living creatures.
- If your cat is often frightened, play soft classical music at low volume indoors.
- Do not make a shushing noise to the cat, as this sounds like a hissing sound that can make the cat more uncomfortable and stressful.

> Warning
- Do not bring other pets into the room, as this may stress the cat more.
- If you approach the cat and it screeches and / or curves its back, step back slowly and find another way.
