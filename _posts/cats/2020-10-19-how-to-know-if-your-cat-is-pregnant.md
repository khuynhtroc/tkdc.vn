> The typical gestation period for a cat is about 9 weeks. At the beginning of pregnancy, they show physical and behavioral changes. You will be able to determine if your cat is pregnant with these changes. The best way to know for sure is to get them to the vet. Unless you are a breeder, you will need to sterilize cats, otherwise overbearing will result in many kittens dying from not finding shelter.
