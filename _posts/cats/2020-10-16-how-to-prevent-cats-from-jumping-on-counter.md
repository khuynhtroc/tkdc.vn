Those who keep cats should follow the three methods described below, which include training the cat not to access the restricted area, preparing other items for the cat to satisfy the habit of climbing, and making the surface easier. the fussy face becomes less attractive to them.

## 1. Using the Penalty Mechanism

### 1.1 Set up the penalty mechanism. 

The mechanism, also known as "telemetry", is the act of disciplining the cat but not being present in front of her, so the cat will not associate the punishment with you. If you punish your cat for jumping in a restricted area, he will only avoid it when you are at home. You can make your own for remote punishment, but don't hurt your cat with those devices.

### 1.2 Spread thin baking paper on the edge of the counter. 

This will keep your cat from jumping on the shelf as the cat will come into contact with the paper when it jumps up. The cat will then be frightened by sudden noise and movement, but not physically harmed. Over time, they will link an object's surface to sound and tension and won't jump on it anymore.
- You can fill it with water and place it on the counter. The cat will be startled by the noise and the water inside it. The downside of this method is that the cat can immerse its feet in the water, so if your cat is old or not agile, you should not use this method to avoid entering the water and getting injured.

### 1.3 Make the sound trap. 

Tie a rope around the contacts where your cat would jump onto the shelf. Attach a volatile empty can to the end of the line. If you put it in the right position, when jumping on the counter, the cat will hit the string that vibrates the can, creating a sudden sound that prevents them from jumping on it again.
- To make a more shocking sound, you can put a coin or a small object in the can.

### 1.4 Apply double-sided adhesive to surfaces that are not accessible to cats. 

You can put glue on a few places so that when the cat jumps on it, the glue will stick to the paws, preventing them from approaching again. Cats are very susceptible to distraction and discomfort when something sticks to their feet, so double-sided glue will work.
- You can spread foil over objects. The generated noises will stop the cat from jumping.

### 1.5 Buy a device that will startle your cat and put it on the counter. 

These are devices that startle your cat with a loud noise, sudden movement, or double-sided glue. There are so many models on the market, so you should research what works well.
- A gas trigger is one of the electronic devices that prevents cats from jumping onto a kitchen counter or other restricted surface or area. The motion sensor detects the cat's presence in the restricted area and immediately sprays a strong blast of air into the cat, startling them.
- An activation alarm is another type of device that prevents cats from jumping onto the counter. The motion sensor activates a loud alarm, startling the cat, and alert the owner. Some trigger alarms are pressure-sensitive, so they are activated as soon as the cat touches it or something is pressed on it. There are also some pressure-sensitive cushions that you can use to spread over the counter and activate when the cat jumps on it.
- The silent activation alarm is less annoying than other triggering alarms. This bell makes a high-pitched sound that cannot be heard by humans or dogs but is effective at repelling cats.
- The mounting pad is a non-harmful repellent that can function without the need for power, batteries, or compressed air. This cushion has small, rough lumps that are uncomfortable for your cat to touch. When you touch the mattress on the counter, the cat will jump off immediately.

### 1.6 Activate your own noisy device. 

Hide from your cat and use a noisy device as soon as you see the cat jump onto the counter. There are many types of noise generators to choose from, and some are made for this purpose.
- A blow whistle is an effective way to startle your cat to the point of jumping into a restricted area if you catch it but still hide from your cat. You should not use a whistle that makes too loud sounds, damaging the hearing of your cat or yours.
- Some manufacturers make whistles that make a noise when activated and try to use pheromones to prevent cats from engaging in unwanted behavior. 

## 2. Provide Alternatives

![Prevent-Cats-from-Jumping-on-Counters-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-prevent-cats-from-jumping-on-counter/v4-728px-Prevent-Cats-from-Jumping-on-Counters-Step-7-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Provide supplies for the cat to exercise its natural climbing instinct. 

For example, cats are attracted to what veterinarians call "cylindrical objects"; they will lose interest in the countertops once they have something else to do with their climbing behavior.

![Prevent-Cats-from-Jumping-on-Counters-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-prevent-cats-from-jumping-on-counter/v4-728px-Prevent-Cats-from-Jumping-on-Counters-Step-8-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Place the cylinder near the window. 

Pillars, buildings, or climbing poles are things that allow your cat to climb, sit on high, and look around. In addition, sitting near a window allows your cat to observe natural prey to satisfy her curiosity and loss of attention from jumping onto kitchen shelves or equipment surfaces.

![Prevent-Cats-from-Jumping-on-Counters-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-prevent-cats-from-jumping-on-counter/v4-728px-Prevent-Cats-from-Jumping-on-Counters-Step-9-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Close the cat shelf. 

This type of shelf is actually a piece of wood attached to the inside of a window sill. Just like a pillar and other cat-specific items, this shelf will satisfy your curiosity and stimulate your pet at the same time. Choose windows that get plenty of sunlight, as cats like to stay in the sun, and cat shelves are the perfect place to do this routine near a window with lots of sunlight. In addition, this is also a place where cats can sleep and / or watch everything going on outside, making them no longer focus on the desire to jump on the counter.

### 2.4 Have your cat play with toys on the floor. 

These toys help the cat burn energy, preventing them from jumping on the counter anymore. If you can make your cat attracted to toys that lie on the floor, then you will also stop them interested in jumping on counters. Change toys from time to time so that the cat won't get bored and starts trying to jump on the counter or counter to find new games.
- Many cats love simple toys, like fake mice that you can throw around for them to chase. Even cats can bring your toys!
- Some cats tend to avoid expensive toys, preferring to play around with plastic bags, boxes, shopping baskets, etc. It is a good idea to experiment with a variety of toys to see if your cat likes it. before buying expensive toys.
- Many cat toys today are usually electronic mice set up to run distance or with wheels to roll themselves on the floor. Some other toys incorporate LEDs and other technology. These are very stimulating things to cats, thereby distracting them from their desire to access restricted areas such as kitchen shelves.

### 2.5 Make plenty of cat rest areas around your home in warm, sunny locations. 

Cats especially like places where they can "nest" or burrow. Cats sleep 16 to 20 hours a day, so they no longer have time to climb on the counter. If you allow your cat to rest with attractive cushions, encourage him to sleep on a mattress instead of a counter. You can also make sure that your cat spends all of his time sleeping, rather than having fun indoors like on a table.

![Prevent-Cats-from-Jumping-on-Counters-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-prevent-cats-from-jumping-on-counter/v4-728px-Prevent-Cats-from-Jumping-on-Counters-Step-12.jpg.webp)

### 2.6 Keep the cat in another room while you are cooking. 

That way they won't be curious when they smell the food on the stove. Cats' sense of smell is 40 times more sensitive than that of humans. They can smell whatever you are cooking, and this will spark curiosity when you're not there, so they'll jump on the stove to find the food scent.
- Cats often have no control of curiosity and may jump into the kitchen while you are cooking. In this case, you should carry them to another room to minimize curiosity about the food on the counter and not to jump on it.
- Play with toys and have a cozy place to sleep when you take them to another room while you cook in the kitchen so that they will still feel excited and comfortable.
- Not all cats are locked in a room while you are cooking, so don't be surprised to see them moan in the room. If this is the case, don't keep them locked up for too long so you don't get stressed.

## 3. Make the Counter Unattractive

![Prevent-Cats-from-Jumping-on-Counters-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-prevent-cats-from-jumping-on-counter/v4-728px-Prevent-Cats-from-Jumping-on-Counters-Step-13.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Eliminate food from people that might attract cats. 

As mentioned above, cats have a strong sense of smell, so leftovers on the counter can cause them to jump up and eat all the grease, crumbs, or food spills that you forgot to clean. , in addition to scratching or biting kitchenware. If you do have to keep the food on a shelf, place it in a sturdy, sturdy container that the cat won't spoil or chew.

![Prevent-Cats-from-Jumping-on-Counters-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-prevent-cats-from-jumping-on-counter/v4-728px-Prevent-Cats-from-Jumping-on-Counters-Step-14.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Clean kitchen shelves regularly. 

This step helps remove food odors that are still on the surface. You can effectively clean the kitchen with a disinfectant towel to remove odors that attract cats and keep the kitchen counter clean and sanitary.
- Choose a bleach or disinfectant that smells like citrus, aloe, eucalyptus, or psyllium. These scents will help keep cats away from restricted areas. Alternatively, you can also use perfumes for the same results.

![Prevent-Cats-from-Jumping-on-Counters-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-prevent-cats-from-jumping-on-counter/v4-728px-Prevent-Cats-from-Jumping-on-Counters-Step-15.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Consider feeding your cat more.

Maybe the cat jumps to the kitchen in search of food because they are hungry. You can determine this by feeding your cat more than usual. If they no longer jump to the kitchen after being fed more, then you have this problem solved. However, some cats overeat, even if you overfeed, they still have a habit of jumping on the kitchen counter. Be prepared for this when you feed your cat more in order to deal with intrusion into the kitchen.
- If you are not ready in time, you can keep a bowl of dry food ready for your cat while begging. Many cats have a habit of eating several meals a day instead of eating a complete meal. If your cat has this habit, be sure to have a bowl of dry food on hand, as long as you don't exceed the daily serving size on the package (unless your veterinarian directs you to do so). Alternatively, you can feed your cat several small meals throughout the day if it feels convenient, but mostly provide enough food so she won't jump on the stove to find food.
- Observe your cat's eating habits and weight to prevent obesity if you change your normal feeding schedule.

### 3.4 Cleaning up items on the counter can stimulate cat fuss. 

If the table has a cat toy or other object that makes the cat like to play, then he or she will try to jump to get to the toy. Remember, it's not just toys that excite your cat. They can jump on the counter to play with keys, pens, lip balm, and papers.
- You should also be aware that cat toys should not be stored near the counter area, for example in a closet. If your cat sees you putting a toy in it, it will jump up to pick up her toy.

![Prevent-Cats-from-Jumping-on-Counters-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-prevent-cats-from-jumping-on-counter/v4-728px-Prevent-Cats-from-Jumping-on-Counters-Step-17.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Close windows near the counter area. 

Make sure to leave the curtains on windows that the cat can access through the counter. Cats love to look out for birds, chipmunks, and the outside world, so they tend to jump on the counter so they can look out the window (see Method 2).

### 3.6 Use alcohol or lemon essential oil to clean surfaces. 

Cats don't like the smell of lemons, so this should work for them.

> Warning
- Never use mechanism when a cat is in unusual anxiety. Maybe they are too scared to walk normally indoors.
- Never beat or yell at a cat to keep it off the counter. Cats are not able to associate punishment with behavior, so they will only become afraid of you.
