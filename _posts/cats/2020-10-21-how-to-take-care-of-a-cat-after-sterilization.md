> Sterilization is a routine task, but its essence is still a surgical process. If you are concerned about how to care for your cat after it has been spayed (female) or neutered (male cats), don't panic! You have found the right place. Here are the steps you can take to help your cat recover from surgery and return to a healthy, active life.

## 1. Create a Safe Recovery Space

### 1.1 Provide a comfortable and quiet space for the cat. 

They may feel nauseous and uncomfortable for the first 18-24 hours after anesthesia. There is a chance that your cat will bounce off people and other animals, so it is important to provide a quiet and isolated space for them to rest.
- Make sure you can still observe the cat while it is resting. Block off all hidden dangerous locations as well as places you cannot easily reach.
- Keep children and other pets away from the cat. They need rest and recovery, and this becomes more difficult if it is continually interrupted or bothered by the surrounding agent.

### 1.2 Make your cat comfortable. 

Make sure you have a comfortable bed for your cat to sleep on. If you don't have a nest, you can use a soft pillow or blanket to go inside the box.
- If possible, place your cat's nest in an area with brick or wood floors. Cats love to cool off their tummy by stretching out on a cool, hard floor, and this can help soothe the wound.

### 1.3 Low brightness adjustment. 

After anesthesia cats are often sensitive to light. You should dim the lights in the cat's nest area, or turn off the lights.
- If you can't adjust the light, you can choose a dome bed to block the glare on your cat.

### 1.4 Keep clean litter boxes and food and drink near the cat's bedside. 

To recover from surgery, your cat should not jump, climb stairs, or try to stretch out in search of food.
- Do not use regular toilet soil for at least a week after surgery. This soil can get into the incision and cause infection, especially male cats. You should use scrap paper or newspaper, toilet soil made of scrap paper, or long grain rice poured into the tray.

### 1.5 Keep the cat indoors. 

Do not let your cat go out for at least two weeks after spaying or spaying. This step helps to keep the wound clean, dry, and free from infection.

## 2. Caring for your Cat after Surgery

![Take-Care-of-Kittens-Step-6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-take-care-of-a-cat-after-sterilization/v4-728px-Care-for-Your-Cat-After-Neutering-or-Spaying-Step-6.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Examine your cat's incision. 

Observing the incision can help to grasp the situation and keep track of the progress. If possible, ask your veterinarian to show you the incision before taking the cat home. You can take a photo of the incision on the first day for convenience.
- Female cats and male cats whose testicles are not retracted in the scrotum will have an incision on their abdomen. Most male cats have two small incisions on the scrotum (under the tail).

### 2.2 Use the "Elizabeth" necklace. 

This can be provided by your veterinarian, or you can buy it from your local pet store. This is a collar that extends over the cat's face so that it cannot touch the incision area.
- This type of necklace is also known as a "guard" necklace, "E-necklace," or a "cone" necklace.

### 2.3 Provide cat food and water. 

You can give your cat a drink from a shallow dish (or ice cubes) as soon as they get home. Your veterinarian will advise you on how to feed, and you should follow the correct order. If not prompted, do the following:
- If your cat seems alert and responsive, you can feed him a quarter of its normal food 2 to 4 hours after surgery. However, you shouldn't force your cat to eat or drink water.
- If your cat can eat, you can offer small meals in 3-6 hours. Repeat this step until the cat has eaten a full portion of food, and then continue with its normal eating schedule.
- If your cat is less than 16 weeks old, you should give it a small meal (about half the normal amount) as soon as you bring the cat home and settle down after surgery.
- If the kitten doesn't eat after returning home, spray maple or corn syrup on a cotton swab or cotton swab and rub it over her gums. 
- Do not give your cat “special” foods, treats, or treats after surgery. Their stomachs may feel uncomfortable, so keep your cat's diet as simple as possible. Do not give milk to cats because their stomachs cannot be digested.

### 2.4 Let your cat rest. 

You should not cuddle or play with them immediately after surgery. This helps the cat feel safe and rested.

![Take-Care-of-Kittens-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-take-care-of-a-cat-after-sterilization/v4-728px-Care-for-Your-Cat-After-Neutering-or-Spaying-Step-10.jpg.webp)

### 2.5 Avoid lifting the cat's body unless it is necessary. 

You can easily tear your cat's incision if you lift or move her body too much. In male cats, avoid putting pressure on the scrotum (under the tail). For female cats (and male cats who have had testicles that do not enter the scrotum), avoid putting pressure on the abdomen.
- If you need to lift the cat, try this method: cuddle the cat's hind legs with one hand and support the chest just below the foreleg with the other. Gently lift their bodies.

![Take-Care-of-Kittens-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-take-care-of-a-cat-after-sterilization/v4-728px-Care-for-Your-Cat-After-Neutering-or-Spaying-Step-11.jpg.webp)

### 2.6 Limit your cat's movements. 

For the next few weeks after surgery, make sure the cat is not running around, playing, or moving too much. This could cause irritation or infection of the wound
- Moving trees, hedges, and other furniture stimulates the cat to jump there.
- Keep the cat in a small room like the laundry or bathroom, or in a crib or crate when you can't supervise it.
- Consider bringing the cat up and downstairs. They are not capable of damaging the incision while going up and downstairs, but this is a reasonable precaution.
- Understand that your cat is in pain just as any cat that has just undergone surgery may try to escape. You should exercise caution in monitoring your cat, especially during the first 24-48 hours after surgery.

![Take-Care-of-Kittens-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-take-care-of-a-cat-after-sterilization/v4-728px-Care-for-Your-Cat-After-Neutering-or-Spaying-Step-12.jpg.webp)

### 2.7 Avoid bathing your cat. 

Do not bathe them for 10-14 days after surgery. Otherwise, it may cause irritation or infection of the wound. 
- If necessary, you can clean the area around the incision with a damp cloth (do not use soap), but do not allow water to get into it. Do not rub the incision area. 

![Take-Care-of-Kittens-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-take-care-of-a-cat-after-sterilization/v4-728px-Care-for-Your-Cat-After-Neutering-or-Spaying-Step-13.jpg.webp)

### 2.8 Only give your cat pain relievers if directed by your veterinarian. 

The doctor can prescribe medication for the cat when he gets home. In that case, give your cat the medication as directed, even if you don't notice that the cat is in pain. Cats are very good at covering up pain and never show it out. Never give any medication to your cat without a prescription from your veterinarian.
- Medicines for humans, and even drugs for other animals like dogs, can kill cats! Do not give them any medications, even over-the-counter medications that your veterinarian has not determined to be suitable for cats. Even some medicines like Tylenol can be fatal to them. 
- Do not apply any product to your cat's incision, including antibiotics or antiseptic creams, unless your veterinarian has authorized it to use it. 

## 3. Track Your Cat's Condition

![Take-Care-of-Kittens-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-take-care-of-a-cat-after-sterilization/v4-728px-Care-for-Your-Cat-After-Neutering-or-Spaying-Step-14.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Watch for signs of vomiting. 

If your cat vomits after eating the night you come home from surgery, get rid of the food right away. Feed them a small amount the next morning. If your cat is vomiting again or has diarrhea, contact your veterinarian.

![Take-Care-of-Kittens-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-take-care-of-a-cat-after-sterilization/v4-728px-Care-for-Your-Cat-After-Neutering-or-Spaying-Step-15.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Check your incision every morning and night. 

7-10 days after surgery, you should check your cat's incision every morning and night. Compare the incision the first day after surgery to determine if it has healed. Contact your veterinarian if you notice any of the following:
- Red. The incision may initially be pink-red or bright red in the surrounding border. This red color should fade with time. If the red color becomes darker or turns black, this could be an indication of an infection.
- Bruising. It is normal for some mild bruises to turn from red to purple as they heal. If the bruise is widespread, worse, or worse, however, or if a new bruise appears, you need to seek immediate medical attention.
- Swelling. Swelling around the incision is a normal part of the healing process, but if the swelling hasn't gone down or gets worse, you should contact your veterinarian.
- Secretion. You will see a very small amount of bright red discharge around the incision when you bring your cat home. This may be normal, but if the incision is discharging for more than a day, the volume is increasing, bloody, green, yellow, white, or foul-smelling, then you need to see your cat doctor.
- The edges on the incision were exposed. In male cats, the scrotum incision will open, but should only be open to a small area, and should close quickly. A female or male cat that has had abdominal surgery may or may not have obvious stitches. If there are visible stitches on the cat's body, it should be left intact. If there are no distinct stitches, the edges of the wound may remain closed. If the incision begins to open or you notice anything, including the suture material protruding from the wound, the cat should be referred to the vet immediately.

### 3.3 Examine your cat's gums. 

This part should be pale pink or red. When pressed lightly on the gums and released, the color should return to integrity quickly. If your gums are white or do not return to normal color after being pressed, contact your veterinarian.

![Take-Care-of-Kittens-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-take-care-of-a-cat-after-sterilization/v4-728px-Care-for-Your-Cat-After-Neutering-or-Spaying-Step-17.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Look for signs of pain. 

Cats do not usually exhibit pain the way humans (or even dogs) do. Watch for signs of discomfort in your cat. If any signs of pain are detected, then the cat needs help and you should call the vet. Common signs of pain after surgery in cats include:
- Hiding constantly or trying to escape
- Depression or lethargy
- Anorexia
- Have a bent posture
- Stomach abdominal muscles
- Growl
- Hissed
- Anxiety or fuss

### 3.5 Watch for other warning signs. 

Make sure your cat is recovering by observing its behavior. Anything that doesn't seem "normal" should go away within 24 hours of surgery. If you notice unusual behavior or symptoms in your cat, contact your veterinarian immediately. Here are some signs to look out for:
- Lethargic for more than 24 hours after surgery
- Diarrhea
- Vomiting after the first night
- Fever or chills
- Loss of appetite for more than 24-48 hours after surgery
- Never eat anything after 24 hours (adult cats) or 12 hours (kittens)
- Difficult or painful urination
- Do not go outside for more than 24-48 hours after surgery

![Take-Care-of-Kittens-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-take-care-of-a-cat-after-sterilization/v4-728px-Care-for-Your-Cat-After-Neutering-or-Spaying-Step-19.jpg.webp)

### 3.6 Contact emergency veterinarian. 

In most cases, contacting your regular veterinarian once the problem is discovered is enough to help your cat recover. However, in some cases, you should seek urgent care for your cat. Call the emergency doctor or veterinarian if you notice any of the following in your cat:
- Fainting
- No response
- Shortness of breath
- Signs of extreme pain
- Altered mental state (the cat does not seem to recognize you or the surroundings, or behaves very abnormally)
- A swollen abdomen
- Bleed

### 3.7 Make follow-up appointments.

Your cat may not have skin stitches (sutures visible). However, if your cat has skin stitches, your veterinarian will need to remove it 10-14 days after surgery.
- Even if your cat has no stitches, you should continue to see your cat as advised by your doctor.

> Advice
- Keep the cat away from children for the first day after surgery.
- Use newsprint or "dust-free" toilet soil for more convenient cleaning.
- Keep a castrated male cat away from normal female cats for at least 30 days after surgery. Male cats can still conceive a female cat for up to 30 days after spaying.

> Warning
- Do not let the cat go out for at least 7-10 days as this may damage the wound.
