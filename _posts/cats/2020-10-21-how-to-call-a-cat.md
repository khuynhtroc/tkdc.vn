## 1. Prepare to call the cat

### 1.1 Understand the benefits of calling a cat. 

Asking your cat to come to him when he hears a call has various benefits. For example, you can call your pet when it's playtime or mealtime. You can also call your cat if you can't find it in your home. Plus, getting your cat close when you hear a call can also help ensure that your cat is safe if you have to leave the house.
- If the cat is indoors / outdoors, you can call it inside.
- Calling your cat is also helpful when it's time to get her vet. the cat may not like going to the vet, so give him some time to be with you when it's time to see it.
- Cats are intelligent animals, so training them up close is called a fairly effective form of brain training.

### 1.2 Reward selection. 

Positive reinforcement (praise, cuddling) is an important part of successful training, but to teach your cat how to respond to a call you need a compelling reward. The best rewards for cats are good food, such as tuna, shredded chicken, or mackerel. [You can also purchase cat treats at the pet store. 
- Prepare plenty of junk food. Every time you reward your cat, change a variety of foods so that they don't expect the same kind of reward each time.
- Catmint leaves are not a great reward. Cats will lose interest in catmint leaves if you reward them more than once a week, so choose a treat as food to attract them. 
- Whichever treat you choose, use it only when you call your cat. They need to have the same connection between an attractive reward and responding to your call and no command or verbal suggestion. 
- The catch might be playtime.

### 1.3 Determine the voice tag when calling your cat. 

You can use any voice tag. The common voice command that people use is "Come here, Miu Miu." You can also use the words "come here" or "reward."Don't use old voice tags, such as the cat's name.
- You can use many different tones. Cats often respond to high tones, because their natural prey makes a high pitched sound. 
- If more than one person in the house calls cats, everyone needs to use the same voice tag and tone to call them. 
- If your cat is deaf or hard of hearing, you may need to use a different method of calling it, such as visual voice commands by turning the light on and off or using a laser pointer (available at pet stores). Deaf or hard of hearing cats can also respond to vibrations on the floor, so you can stomp on the floor to call your cat. 

## 2. Call the cat

### 2.1 Choose when to call your cat. 

A good time to call your cat is mealtime. Then the cat feels hungry and makes the training easier and faster. Also, cats are used to going to the kitchen (or going to a bowl of food), so don't call your cat to a strange place when starting training.
- The benefit of calling your cat at mealtime is that they know when food is ready. This makes the initial training easier because you are not doing anything strange to them.
- If you choose to reward your cat with extra playtime, you can start calling your cat when it is almost time for her to play.
- If your cat's kitchen or play area is a bit noisy, call your cat in a quiet place that won't distract her so she can come near you.

### 2.2 Call the cat. 

When you are at the place where you want your cat to go, you can use a high voice command. If you call your cat when it's time to eat, make sure you say the voice command before opening the can or tearing the food bag. Make sure that the cat is approaching because they can hear the voice command, not because of the noise when preparing food.
- Immediately reward your cat when it comes close with fresh, delicious food, or let the cat play for a while. Enhanced positive reinforcement through petting and praise is also helpful.
- Even if it's time to call your cat when it's time to eat, you should still enjoy a treat instead of just offering the usual food.
- When calling out to your cat while playing, call out a voice command without shaking a noisy toy.
- The training takes about a week or more for the cat to always be close when it comes to hearing your call.

### 2.3 Add a challenge in your cat calling training. 

After your cat has entered the play or dining area upon hearing a call, you can increase the difficulty of training. For example, if you live with another person, you can take turns calling the cat. Each person then needs to reward the pet when it correctly responds to the call. 
- If your cat is indoors / outdoors, you can call it inside while outside. This is easier when the cat is relatively close to home to hear your call.
- Practice calling your cat when you are in each position of the house. Eventually, the cat will learn how to get close to you no matter where in the house.

> Advice
- As with other training, kittens are often easier to teach than adults. If your cat is an adult, it will take longer for the cat to respond to the call.
- Call the cat a few times a day. Calling your cat at food times can help you practice several times a day.
- Reward your cat even if it responds to the call for a long time. It may be that the cat is deliberately waiting a long time before approaching (which can be annoying), but it's important to still reward your pet when it decides to listen to your call. 
- If your cat is unresponsive because he cannot hear a call, you should have him examined his ear. 
- The cat may not come close when called because it feels embarrassed or scared. You should consult with your veterinarian or veterinarian to help your cat overcome fears or fears.
