> Cats can be infected with a variety of worms such as roundworms, hookworms, tapeworms, and filariasis. These worms are not only dangerous for cats but also risk infecting humans and other pets. So, in addition to deworming kittens, newly adopted cats, and cats with symptoms of worm infection, talk to your veterinarian about a regular worm testing and control program. Knowing when to bleach the worm is just as important as how to do it.

## 1. Diagnosis of worms in cats

![Deworm-Cats-Step-1]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deworm-in-cats/v4-728px-Deworm-Cats-Step-1-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.1 Check your cat's feces. 

The most common sign of worm infection is eye worms. You can look at the cat's feces for worms. The tapeworm segments are often severed and excreted in the stool. These flukes look like small grains of rice. You can even see them moving like tiny worms in fresh manure.
- Look for signs of diarrhea. Some illnesses can cause diarrhea in cats. However, all types of intestinal worms such as roundworms, hookworms, and tapeworms can cause loose stools. In other cases, your cat may experience colon bleeding and intestinal irritation. 
- You should collect the worms in a bag and test them in the vet.

### 1.2 Watch for signs of vomiting. 

Roundworms can cause vomiting in cats. Cats may even vomit large, pasta-like worms. Vomiting is also a potential symptom of filariasis. As with fecal problems, you should try to collect your cat's vomit in a small bag. Your veterinarian can test the vomitus to diagnose helminths and many other conditions. Be aware that vomiting is not a symptom of a worm infection, but a symptom of many other diseases.

### 1.3 Keep track of your cat's weight. 

Cats with intestinal helminths or worms may only lose weight. Your cat's weight can vary markedly or unequivocally, depending on the size and number of worms. In other cases, your cat may experience an enlarged stomach and develop a "bulge belly". Cats are at risk of ringworm if their tummy is round.

### 1.4 Check your cat's gums. 

Normally, a healthy cat's gums are pink. Many worm-like parasites can cause anemia or extreme shock and lead to pale gums. If you find that your cat's gums are pale, you should make an appointment with your veterinarian. If your cat is having trouble breathing or lethargic, take the cat to the vet immediately.

### 1.5 Learn about the types of worms your cat can catch. 

Know what worms your cat has before seeking treatment. Your veterinarian can determine the type of worms your cat is infected with and prescribe appropriate medications and treatments. You don't have to know each type of worms too well, but at least know the types of worms that are common in cats like:
- Roundworm is the most common parasite in cats. Nursing kittens can get roundworms from their mother's milk, and adult cats are at risk of fecal infection.
- Tapeworms are fractional parasites, usually found in the hair around a cat's hind legs. Cats are at risk for a tapeworm infection by ingesting a flea that is infected with it.
- Hookworms are smaller than nematodes and reside in the small intestine. Hookworms are spread by skin or digestive contact. Hookworms are a common problem in dogs.
- Lungworms reside in cats' lungs and are not as common as other worms. Cats are at risk for lungworm infection by ingesting an infected host, such as birds or rodents.
- Worms are just the most dangerous parasites. When a mosquito bites an animal that is infected with filariasis, it carries the filariasis in its blood. The larvae will grow and continue to pass on to another animal when the animal is bitten in the blood by a mosquito.

### 1.6 Take your cat to the vet. 

You should not self-treat your cat worms without the help of a veterinarian. Your veterinarian can analyze a stool sample and diagnose worms in your cat. You need to collect a stool sample and bring it to the vet for testing. If you suspect your cat is infected with filariasis, your veterinarian may take a blood sample periodically. There are many different types of worms, and each has its own treatment, so it's important to know exactly what kind of worms your cat has before starting treatment.
- Usually, cats need to be treated with deworming after 2 weeks or 1 month. Worm treatment is not one time done.
- You may find a number of websites that show how to treat worms at home with "natural remedies" such as herbs and spices. You should not believe this information and it is best to take your cat to the vet.
- Deworming newborn or newly adopted kittens. This is a common procedure of whether or not a cat has a worm infection. Kittens need to be dewormed after 2-6 weeks until 3 months of age and monthly until 6 months. Newly adopted kittens need immediate deworming with at least 2 additional bleaches every 2 weeks. The mother cat can infect her kittens with worms.

## 2. Treat your cat's worms

![Deworm-Cats-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deworm-in-cats/v4-728px-Deworm-Cats-Step-7-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Give your cat a prescription medication. 

Get the required medication from your veterinarian. You should not give your cat, especially kittens, over-the-counter deworming agents without consulting your vet. Cats can be given a range of pills or pills in different forms such as tablets, capsules, nuggets, chewable tablets, water, or topical.
- Follow your veterinarian's instructions on how and how often to give your cat medication instead of choosing it yourself. Once you know what medicine and how often to give your cat, you should follow the full course of treatment prescribed by your veterinarian. Whether it is oral or topical, you should give it to your cat until the treatment is over.

### 2.2 Watch out for side effects. 

The drug tends to be more toxic to the parasite (worms) than to the host (kittens). This is why you need the help of a veterinarian to get the right medication for your cat after being instructed. Some of the side effects of the worm bleach are diarrhea and vomiting. Talk to your veterinarian about the possible or unlikely side effects of bleach and make sure your cat responds properly to the medication.

### 2.3 Treatment of ringworm and hookworm. 

The most common treatment for ringworm and hookworm in adult cats is Pyrantel Pamoate, Oxime Milbemycin, and Selamectin. Pyrantel Pamoate and Oxime Milbemycin are oral medications, while Selamectin is topical. In the US, Pyrantel Pamoate is an available over-the-counter drug, while Selamectin and Milbemycin Oxime are prescription drugs. Selamectin is not suitable for use in kittens under 8 weeks of age, so kittens should only be given oral deworming bleach.

![Deworm-Cats-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deworm-in-cats/v4-728px-Deworm-Cats-Step-10-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 Treatment of tapeworms. 

The two drugs commonly used to treat tapeworms are Praziquantel and Epsiprantel. Both are oral medications. Praziquantel is a readily available over-the-counter medication, while Epsiprantel needs a prescription.
- Usually, the veterinarian needs to re-test the stool to make sure the bleach is working. Be sure to follow your veterinarian's instructions when deworming your cat and having your cat see you again to see if the deworming is working.

![Deworm-Cats-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deworm-in-cats/v4-728px-Deworm-Cats-Step-11-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.5 Take the cat for re-examination. 

Your veterinarian will have you with you on the next appointment schedule. Follow the instructions and have the kitten follow-up for the next treatment or to make sure the worms are completely eliminated. You should take your cat to see the veterinarian help keep the cat happy and healthy.

## 3. Give your cat medicine

![Deworm-Cats-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deworm-in-cats/v4-728px-Deworm-Cats-Step-12-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Prepare the medicine. 

Shake the vial if necessary or remove the pills from the vial. You can put the liquid medicine in a syringe or dropper. Your veterinarian can tell you which medication guide is ideal for you.
- Keep the medicine out of your cat's sight. Your cat may spot the pill or bottle and run the risk of running away. Sometimes it is best to prepare the medication a few minutes in advance and wait for the cat to calm down so that it is safer to take the medication.

![Deworm-Cats-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deworm-in-cats/v4-728px-Deworm-Cats-Step-13-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Keep the cat calm.

After you've been prescribed medication by your doctor, you need to know how to give your cat the medication. The process of administering the medication to your cat can be a little tricky, but it should still be fine if you keep your cat calm and happy. If you are prescribed to give your cat medication at home, you need to know how to soothe your cat so that it will be easier to administer the medication.

![Deworm-Cats-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deworm-in-cats/v4-728px-Deworm-Cats-Step-14-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Cover the cat. 

You can wrap the cat in a small blanket, pillowcase, or towel and leave only the head outside. This will help prevent the cat from scratching or resisting. However, you should make sure the cat is not too frightened or suffocated during the wrapping. You can also try giving your cat a pill without wrapping it to help ease her anxiety. However, it is more difficult to administer the medication without wrapping the cat.

![Deworm-Cats-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deworm-in-cats/v4-728px-Deworm-Cats-Step-15-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Keep the cat safe. 

Sit on the floor and hold the cat between your legs, or place the cat on your lap. You can also ask someone else to help you keep the cat. The medication administration process is much easier with help.

![Deworm-Cats-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deworm-in-cats/v4-728px-Deworm-Cats-Step-16-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Hold the cat's head properly. 

Place your thumb and index finger on both sides of the cat's mouth. Be careful, as the cat may try to bite you. Even so, it will still be difficult for the cat to escape from your control.

![Deworm-Cats-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deworm-in-cats/v4-728px-Deworm-Cats-Step-17-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.6 Tilt the cat's head back. 

During this process, gently press on the sides of the mouth to let the cat open. At this point, you must be very calm. If you are anxious, your cat may feel and be more frightened than necessary. Press your cat's lower jaw with your other hand to let her open her mouth wider.

![Deworm-Cats-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deworm-in-cats/v4-728px-Deworm-Cats-Step-18.jpg.webp)

### 3.7 Put the medicine in the cat's mouth. 

Place the pill in your mouth or squeeze the liquid pill onto the inside of one cheek. Be careful not to put the medication in the deep throat to avoid choking on your cat. 

![Deworm-Cats-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deworm-in-cats/v4-728px-Deworm-Cats-Step-19.jpg.webp)

### 3.8 Help your cat swallow the medication. 

Here's how to best help your cat swallow the pill:
- Let the cat close its mouth.
- Raise the cat's chin up so that her nose is pointing up.
- Rub the cat's throat to stimulate the swallowing reflex.
- Hold this position for a few seconds or until the cat has swallowed the medicine. Be very gentle in this process to avoid choking on your cat.

![Deworm-Cats-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deworm-in-cats/v4-728px-Deworm-Cats-Step-20.jpg.webp)

### 3.9 Make sure the medicine has been swallowed up. 

Release the cat's mouth, but be careful in case the cat doesn't swallow the pill and spit it out. You should only release the cat's mouth when you are sure the cat has swallowed the medicine.
- Giving up is a common problem when cats take capsules. It is very difficult for a cat to spit out if given liquid medicine.

![Deworm-Cats-Step-21]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deworm-in-cats/v4-728px-Deworm-Cats-Step-21.jpg.webp)

### 3.10 Praise your cat for successfully giving the medication. 

You can remove the cat's blanket or towel and praise the cat for being good. You should give your cat treats, show concern, and love, as the cat is very docile. This makes it easier to give the next pill. Cats will connect the medication with the good rather than the fearful. Your cat may resist and run away at the next dose of medication if forced or too scared.

## 4. Prevent worms for cats

![Deworm-Cats-Step-22]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deworm-in-cats/v4-728px-Deworm-Cats-Step-22.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Give your cat the parasite vaccine regularly. 

You should consult your veterinarian for more details. Certain drugs such as Selamectin are effective against many types of fleas, filariasis, hookworm, roundworm, and other parasites.

![Deworm-Cats-Step-23]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deworm-in-cats/v4-728px-Deworm-Cats-Step-23.jpg.webp)

### 4.2 Consider keeping your cat indoors. 

To avoid cats infected with worms, fleas, or other rodents that carry worms, keep your cat indoors to reduce the risk of infection. Many owners do not have the heart to keep cats in the house because they feel like they are taking away their freedom. "Why aren't cats allowed to show their natural instincts under fresh air and sunlight?" It is this question that guides their decision. To make the right decisions, you should weigh the pros and cons.
- Are the risks too great? You should consider road conditions, disease factors, environmental issues, and animal and human factors. If you decide to keep your cat indoors to avoid any of the above risks, make it so that it looks like the outdoors with a scratching area, windows, and other things to help the cat climb happily.

![Deworm-Cats-Step-24]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deworm-in-cats/v4-728px-Deworm-Cats-Step-24.jpg.webp)

### 4.3 Get rid of fleas from your home and yard.

In general, there is no need to worry about outdoor space if you keep your cat indoors. Cats can skillfully kill fleas, especially if they are not in an area with too many fleas. For this reason, focus on dealing with areas that your cat frequents.
- Home: The best anti-flea tactic is cleanliness. You should clean pillows, blankets that your cat loves, or other items she lies on often. Cleanly remove fleas, eggs, flea larvae, or young fleas. Likewise, you should eliminate anything related to fleas by vacuuming the carpet. If the fleas are too much, you should consider using a spray. In the process of spraying flea killers, humans and all animals should be kept away according to the instructions on the package. After that, you need to clean your entire house and vacuum again to remove the remains and eggs of fleas and toxins left over from the spray. 
- Indoor fleas: Controlling fleas outdoors is often much more difficult. You should start by removing organic debris such as grass clippings, leaves, and straw. Fleas like to live in dark, moist, and shady areas. You should buy an environmentally safe flea spray and destroy it according to the instructions on the product packaging. 

![Deworm-Cats-Step-25]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deworm-in-cats/v4-728px-Deworm-Cats-Step-25.jpg.webp)

### 4.4 Clean your cat litter box regularly. 

You should remove the stool regularly to prevent the spread of worms. Wear disposable plastic gloves and a respirator if possible so as not to inhale fecal dust. Put all of the cat's trash in the trash bag. You can also use a paper towel and a natural antibacterial spray to clean the inside of the litter box. You can even thoroughly rinse the litter box with soapy water, then replace the sand with new, clean sand. You should clean the litter box 1-2 times a week, depending on what your cat needs.
