title: "How to calm a cat into heat?"
summary: An unspayed female cat will go into heat, meaning she is ready to mate, once every three to four weeks. Usually, the female will howl, hiss, squirm and attempts to lure or run away with the male cat. It is not easy to reassure a female cat, and more importantly, it is only a temporary measure. This is a natural, normal behavior when a cat is in heat, no matter how annoying the owner is. If you can't manage it, look for a long-term solution instead of taking a temporary step.

## 1. Calm your Cat to Heat

### 1.1 Recognize that your cat is in the midst of breeding. 

You need to make sure the behavior they're doing is signaling they're in heat and not sick. A cat that has not been spayed until this stage will make a lot of noises, get nervous, rub against people and objects, and roll on the floor. If you stroke your lower back, they will respond by lifting your pelvis and moving the tail to the side.
- The normal breeding season for cats is between spring and late summer. They will go into heat during this time of the year.
- Identify if your cat is fertile or sick. If your cat is nervous but does not rub her body against an object and lift her tail to the side, she may be sick. You need to take your cat to see your veterinarian find out the problem.

### 1.2 Separate the female cat from the male cat. 

When the female cat reaches this stage, she will be even more agitated if the male is present. Keep your cat out, and close all windows and door locks, including small pet doors. To calm the female cat (and prevent her pregnancy), you need to keep her away from the male cat. Isolation also keeps the female cat safe - she can escape if she senses the male cat outside. 
- If you have a male cat in the same house, find a friend, or hire a babysitter for a few weeks. If two cats are in the same place, they will instinctively mate.
- If the female cat can see the male cat through the window, cover the window with curtains or cardboard.

### 1.3 Have the cat sit on a hot object. 

Although this is not a guarantee of success, some people believe that a female cat, when sitting on a hot pad or a warm towel, will become calmer and quieter. A microwave heating pad may be the easiest option, as you can quickly reheat it when your cat starts to agitate again. You can also use an electric heating pad/blanket.

### 1.4 Only use cat peppermint if it is soothing to them. 

Cats have many different reactions to this plant. Some go into a relaxed and quiet state when given catmint leaves, but others become agitated and aggressive. If you don't know how your cat reacts to peppermint leaves, avoid this method as this can make the situation worse.
- Note that this is only a temporary measure, but it can still bring you peace within an hour or two.

### 1.5 Check to see if herbal remedies are working. 

There are many herbal remedies on the market that have calming effects on cats. Some people have tried it with success, but none of them works on all cats. Furthermore, cats may not react to this type of product. Buy a small collection of samples and try a variety of remedies. Once you find the right product, you can buy it in bulk.
- Follow the instructions on the label. You can add the product to your cat's drinking water, rub a few drops on their fur, or use it as a room fragrance.
- Do not use human products, as there is a chance that the dosage will be higher.

### 1.6 Use Feliway indoors. 

Feliway is a synthetic cat pheromone that calms the spirit of cats. Even so, it takes several weeks of exposure to calm the cat, so it may not be effective immediately. If your cat has not been spayed, consider plugging in the Feliway diffuser at the beginning of the breeding season (spring). That way, whenever cats come to spawning, Feliway will be built up in their body.

### 1.7 Clean up the toilet tray. 

Cats often use urine as scent markers to attract males when they reach the breeding stage. By cleaning the litter box clean, you can encourage your cat to poop in the right place instead of messing around indoors. If they still mark the scent, remove and deodorize the site immediately. Leaving the scent of urine behind will only keep the cat going.
- Do not use cleaning products that contain detergent. The ammonia in bleach is usually present in the urine, and this smell will stimulate your cat to mark that spot again.

### 1.8 Play with your cat. 

This measure may be a temporary distraction, but they will howl shortly after the end. Stroking, scratching, or petting your lower back may be more effective if the cat is calm enough to allow you to do so.

## 2. Sterilization and Other Long Term Solutions

### 2.1 Sterilize for cats. 

This method removes the ovaries and prevents the heat cycle from occurring. It also avoids pregnancy and reduces the risk of cancer and other diseases. 
- If you cannot afford the cost of surgery, you can seek low-cost sterilization. Many clinics offer this for a low price because it reduces the number of stray cats.
- Look up your region in the databases listed on the USDA website.
- Ovarian tissue is likely to remain and make the cat still fertile even after surgery. If this happens, you should consult a veterinarian.

### 2.2 Wait until your heat is over before sterilizing. 

Your veterinarian can perform the sterilization procedure at any point in your cat's hormonal cycle - even if they're in a sensitive phase. However, cats are at increased risk of blood loss after that time. This is feasible, but you should still consult an experienced veterinarian.

### 2.3 Use hormonal therapy as a last resort. 

The hormones prostaglandin and estrogen can be used to stop your cat's heat cycle. However, this method has serious side effects including uterine infection and tumor formation. Because of the significant risks, this should be done only if you can't get your cat's ovarian procedure in place. Always consult a veterinarian before using hormones whether prescribed or purchased from a pet store. Even if it is not possible to sterilize a cat for medical reasons, risks cannot calm the cat.
