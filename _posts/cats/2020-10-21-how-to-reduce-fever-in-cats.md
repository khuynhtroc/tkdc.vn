title: "How to reduce fever in cats?"
summary: For humans like cats, fever is not necessarily a bad condition. This is just a normal immune response that helps the body recover from illnesses by destroying bacteria that cannot tolerate high temperatures. Furthermore, the heat increases blood flow to damaged tissues for normal recovery. However, in some cases, a fever can be dangerous. If your cat has a fever, you can fix it so that it recovers more quickly. Alternatively, you might also consider using medications to speed recovery in your cat.

- Preparing instruments. You will need a thermometer, lubricant (grease or KY), alcohol, paper towels, and cat food.
- If you are using a mercury thermometer, you need to shake it many times until the mercury inside the weight falls below the 35-degree mark. For electronic thermometers, just turn on the power button. You can use a special thermometer designed for pets to measure the temperature in the ear canal.
- If you take the temperature in your rectum, lubricate the thermometer.
- Hold the cat in one hand, or have someone else hold it for you. Raise their tails.
- Insert the thermometer into the anus about 2.5 cm. Keep the mercury thermometer in place for 2 minutes. Unplug the electronic thermometer when it beeps.

### 1.3 Examine the cat's body. 

Gently use your fingers to press and rub their body. (This is called palpation. ) Determine if there is any damage, such as a fracture, swollen lymph nodes, ulcers, festering wounds, or a tumor. All of these can lead to an increase in body temperature.
- Sometimes you may or may not be able to feel a broken bone inside your cat's body. Broken bones often have swelling or bruising. If you press on the injured area, the cat will feel pain. Be careful when examining their body.
- If the lymph nodes are enlarged, you should feel them in your cat's lower jaw and near the shoulder. Also, the hind legs and groin may have swollen lymph nodes.
- When you notice one of these signs, you should take the cat to see a veterinarian immediately for prompt medical treatment.

### 1.4 Reduce your cat's fever. 

Cats lose heat through sweat glands in their paws and by breathing. You can cool their bodies so they can cool down. Place your cat in a cool, no-light room and lay it on stone or tile floors so she can stretch her body and transfer heat to the tile floor. You can also apply the following methods:
- Turn on a fan on the floor to blow air into her body.
- Place an ice pack on their body or feet.
- If the cat doesn't object, gently moisten the cat's body. Use a damp cloth or spray bottle to moisten the coat. The steam will lower your cat's body temperature.

### 1.5 Give the cat plenty of fluids. 

Fever can be caused by lack of water, and also leads to dehydration. You must keep them fresh with clean water. If your cat is unable to drink water on its own, you can use a support pump ( no needles included). Cats who drink enough fluids will reduce fever quickly (this is why veterinary clinics often give cats fluids).
- If your cat has a fever, it is unlikely that your cat will want to get up and move around, so keep the water bowl near her nest. You can wipe their gums with a sponge soaked in warm water.
- Alternatively, you can give your sick pet a Gatorade or a children's electrolyte solution. This helps restore the electrolyte balance in the cat's body, especially if the cat is vomiting or has diarrhea. You can give your cat Gatorade with a pump sickness.
- If your cat refuses to drink with a plunger, freeze the water or Gatorade. Your cat will prefer to lick the ice cube instead of drinking it (and the cold will also help lower her temperature).
- Never give your cat milk! Cats are very sensitive to lactose, so milk can worsen fever and cause nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

### 1.6 Make sure your cat is eating and drinking normally. 

Fever often causes cats to lose a lot of energy and physical weaknesses. They probably won't eat solid food. Replace it with softer foods, such as soft pickled eggs or canned tuna.
- If your cat is not eating solid or soft food, you can use a syringe to provide cat replacements (these can be found at pet stores). This is food for sick cats or lactating orphan kittens. Use a syringe (no needles attached) with a capacity of 5cc to 10cc.
- Insert the tip of the plunger into the inside of the mouth, close to the cheek. Cats and dogs often reflexively swallow anything that passes through this area.
- If your pet is unable to eat anything, consult your veterinarian about a high-calorie liquid supplement. Cats can absorb this supplement until they are well enough to eat solid food again.

### 1.7 Add B vitamins and energy to your cat. 

You can boost your pet's appetite by including vitamin B-complex foods and energy in their meals.
- Vitamin and energy supplements like Nutri-Plus Gel (5ml per day for 5 days) can combat fatigue and nutritional deficiencies.
- An example of a B-complex vitamin is Coforta. This type has a high cyanocobalamin (3) content and is essential for energy conversion. Inject under the cat's skin or muscles from 0.5 ml to 2.5 ml once a day for 5 days:
- For small cats weighing 1kg or less, 0.5 ml
- For cats 2 to 6 kg, 1 ml
- For large cats from 7 to 9 kg, 2.5 ml
- If your cat's weight fluctuates in these ranges, you should estimate the corresponding dosage or follow the instructions of your veterinarian, in case of uncertainty, a small dose should be used.
- Never give your cat supplements that contain the following ingredients, as they may be toxic to cats:
- Garlic or onions
- Calcium
- Vitamin D
- Vitamin C

### 2.1 Take your cat to see the vet. 

If your cat's condition does not improve after 24 hours of home treatment, you should consult your veterinarian. A prolonged fever can be caused by a serious illness. Your veterinarian will check and test to determine the cause of the fever.
- Provide a recent medical history of the cat. You can give information about movement history, another animal contact, recent immunizations or other treatments, allergies, and anything else you think might cause a fever. in cats.

- Infections caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi
- Injury to the body
- Autoimmune disease
- Dead tissue

### 2.2 Use antibiotics if recommended by your veterinarian. 

If your cat fever is caused by a bacterial infection, you will need to treat the infection. Usually, the antibiotic is sufficient for reducing fever in pets. Antibiotics are generally safe for cats with a fever, but you should not give them to them. You will need to contact your veterinarian to test and prescribe antibiotics for your cat. Antibiotics are usually effective against one strain of bacteria and are not effective against others. Your veterinarian will advise the most suitable medicine for your pet. The most common and safe antibiotics commonly prescribed by veterinarians include:
- Ampicillin and Amoxicillin (20mg / kg body weight). These two types are available in liquid form and can be found in "human" pharmacies.
- Marbofloxacin (2mg / kg) is available in tablet form. However, it is difficult to determine the dosage because the pill is small in size.
- Doxycycline (5mg / kg) is available in the form of a jelly, and a preparation that is sold by prescription from a veterinarian. This preparation is Vibravet, which comes with a plastic tube to determine the correct dose.
- The duration of antibiotics for a cat is always one week (7 days). Always give them the right amount, even if the cat has recovered better. If you shorten the time taking the medication, the infection may return and resist the effects of antibiotics.

### 2.3 See Meloxicam. 

Known as Metacam, this is an antipyretic drug with similar effects to Tolfedine. Many countries have adopted this drug. However, not all studies have confirmed the safe level of use for cats. Use only under the guidance of a veterinarian. The recommended dose is 0.05 mg/kg of meloxicam daily for cats, during or after meals. A cat weighing 5 kg needs 0.5 ml of Metacam.
- Note that meloxicam is produced in two forms: for dogs (1.5 mg / ml) and for cats (0.5 mg / ml). You need to give your cat the proper form to avoid an overdose.
- Meloxicam should be used only in non-dehydrated cats. Otherwise, it will impair kidney function by reducing blood flow to the kidney and the risk of kidney failure.

### 2.4 Use aspirin only for veterinary purposes. 

Aspirin is not an antipyretic for cats. This type can cause dehydration, vomiting, and several other dangerous symptoms. Use extreme caution when giving aspirin to your cat if recommended by your veterinarian and only in the right amount.
- For cats, the recommended dose is 2.5 mg/kg every 48-72 hours. Use a small dose of pediatric aspirin in the form of 50 mg or 75 mg tablets.
- Give your cat aspirin with food and water. If your cat takes aspirin while hungry, he or she will feel uncomfortable
- When absorbed through the gastric mucosa, aspirin breaks down into salicylic acid. However, cats don't have the enzyme needed to break down salicylic acid. At that time, this acidity remained high for a long time. Cats that take high doses of aspirin or supplements can become poisoned. Therefore, it is extremely important to monitor the dosage while administering the medication to your cat.

### 2.5 Be aware that cats are unable to absorb certain human medications. 

Treatment for fever in cats differs from that of other animals because their physiological functions are not the same. Cats lack a liver enzyme called glucosyltransferase, so they can't break down many drugs that are safe for humans. In many cases, drugs that are safe for dogs but dangerous for cats. Do not give your cat any human medications unless prescribed by your veterinarian. Otherwise, they could be injured or even fatal. 

> Advice
- If your cat refuses to eat or drink, you should take it to the vet. Most likely they need medical help.

> Warning
- Contact your vet if the cat's body temperature exceeds 39 degrees Celsius, or if the cat remains shivering for more than 24 hours.
- Be careful not to make the condition worse. You need to be very cautious when giving your cat human medicine because too much will poison them. Follow your veterinarian's dosage instructions.
- If you are in doubt whether the drug is safe for a pet, you should be cautious. Check with your veterinarian about what medication to take for your cat.
