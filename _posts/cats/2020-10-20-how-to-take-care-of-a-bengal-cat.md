## 1. Meet the basic needs of the Bengal cat

### 1.1 Feed the Bengal cat properly. 

As with any breed of cat, you should feed your pet high quality wet (canned or wrapped) or dry pellets. Follow the instructions on the package to determine the starting amount of food.
- Take care not to let the cat be overweight. Test once a week to see if you can feel your pet's ribs or waistline. If you can't feel the ribs, your cat is overweight and you need to cut back on food by 10%. Then check your cat's weight after a week.

### 1.2 Provide water for the Bengal cat. 

You can fill a bowl with water or buy a running water system at a pet store. If the store doesn't have this item, you can buy it online.
- If you don't want to buy a running water system, have a bowl of water and turn on the faucet in the bathroom from time to time to let them jump on and drink!
- Bengal cats are extremely fond of water. They love to play with water and are attracted to the water. They can sit for hours playing with the water and making the carpet wet. Therefore, you should place the water bowl on a waterproof floor that can dry if the water splashes out too much.
- Note the toilet lid. The Bengal cat can see this as a lake and will dip its feet to splash water everywhere.

### 1.3 Provide a litter box with a lid for the cat! 

They like to feel private when dealing with their sadness. Also prepare a cleaning tray with a high edge. Bengal cats can jump up to three times their body height, so don't hesitate to use a high-sided tray.
- The litter box has a high edge to help prevent cats from going out. If the tray edge is low they will defecate around the tray unhygienic.
- If you want to urinate your cat in the bathroom, you can do it easily on a Bengal! Study the training program and start when Bengal was a child.

### 1.4 Do not do much hygiene for the cat. 

The Bengal cat has a shiny coat that does not require much care. However, like other cats, if you start grooming Bengal as a child, they will love to be cared for when they grow up.
- Use a rubber bristle glove to remove loose hair and maintain shine.

## 2. Health care for Bengal cats

### 2.1 Take the Bengal cat to see you regularly. 

Like all cats, Bengal needs regular health care to lead a long and healthy life. If young, the Bengal cat needs to be vaccinated, wormed, sterilized, and microchipped.
- In order to prove ownership, in case the cat is stolen or found lost, it can be returned to the correct owner.
- Make sure the vet cares for the Bengal cat as not all veterinarians do.

### 2.2 Begins immunization at six weeks of age for temporary protection. 

Repeat after 10 weeks, with the final shot at week 14. The veterinarian will give the basic vaccinations for viral and rabies, as well as discuss leukemia and chlamydia vaccinations in cats.
- Bengal cats show resistance to leukemia vaccination. The reason is not clearly defined but related to the ancestor of the Asian leopard. There is no evidence that Bengal cats are particularly susceptible to this vaccine and that there are no serious complications in this breed.
- The ancestors of Bengal cats do not have natural immunity like some breeds, so if not vaccinated, cats can become infected. However, if your cat lives indoors, you may be more comfortable with the domestic cat as there is less risk of leukemia.

### 2.3 Sterilize for cats. 

Pets need to be sterilized for 5-6 months. However, some breeds of cats need to be sterilized before bringing them home (12 weeks old) to avoid using kittens for breeding.

### 2.4 Worm remover for cats. 

Pets should be dewormed at 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks of age using an oral medication such as Panacur. Some good medications such as Stronghold (UK) or Revolution (US) work within 1 month, so give your cat a monthly dose at 6 weeks of age.

### 2.5 Find out about special health problems in Bengal cats. This breed of cat is at increased risk of Mucitis of the abdominal cavity and chest. The relatively common disease can spread in places where more than five cats live and share litter boxes. Unfortunately, breeding facilities risk becoming a facility for the Coronavirus to mutate and cause clinical peritoneal infection (FIP).

There are no preventive measures for FIP right now, and if you buy a kitten that is carriers of the disease, even with a good diet to boost immunity, you won't be able to prevent your cat from getting FIP later. So you should stay away from possible risks.
- If you have cats and kittens purchased from a breeding facility with a history of FIP, do not share litter boxes with cats. The Coronavirus that causes FIP is spread through waste products, so the closer your cat comes into contact with the feces, the more susceptible it is to disease.
- FIP usually affects cats younger than 12-18 months old and causes high fever, loss of appetite, and fluid leakage in the blood that accumulates under the abdomen. There is currently no cure for this disease.
- Before adopting a kitten, you should ask the breeder about the FIP history in the breed. If they are honest and say they have a problem with the FIP or report the kittens are sick, you will need to find the Bengal kittens at another breeding facility.
- Other health problems include HCM (heart disease), PkDef (chronic anemia), and early recessive disorder that can cause blindness in the first year of life. However, many breeders screen for this and can reduce the risk of disease in cats.
- In Sweden, a Bengal cat has been found to have rhinitis. The scientific conclusion is that skin diseases, especially in Bengal cats, are inherited.

### 2.6 Consider buying pet insurance for your Bengal cat. 

It will cost you an amount each year. However, insurance offers a significant benefit if the cat is in an emergency. Insurance will cover part of the cost depending on the specific policy, and ensure that you do not have to make treatment decisions based on financial factors.

## 3. Train and play with Bengal

![Take-Care-of-a-Bengal-Cat-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-take-care-of-a-bengal-cat/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Bengal-Cat-Step-11-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Create conditions for Bengal to climb. 

This cat likes to climb and the higher they go, the more they like it. If you don't have climbing equipment ready, they'll find a place to climb, such as curtains.
- A cat climbing post is an ideal item with a multi-platform design and mattress nest. If possible you should place each pillar in a different room. Place a climbing post near the window so the cat can climb on it and watch the birds through the window for fun at the same time.

### 3.2 To create entertainment conditions for Bengal so that they do not mess around with the Dharma. 

Prepare lots of toys, and play with them two times a day, each lasting at least 10 minutes (or until the cat feels tired). The Bengal is extremely intelligent and active, so be prepared with a toy that simulates hunting behavior. Otherwise, the cat will find its own joy by destroying the furniture.
- The Bengal cat is very intelligent and has the ability to solve problems. This means they will try to open the pantry or even the refrigerator. It's a good idea to install locks on cabinets that are potentially harmful to cats (such as cleaning products) or pantries.

### 3.3 Have fun with Bengal! 

Playing with your cat can both entertain you and your cat. Cats love to be cared for in a good mood. They also love to sleep with their owners, so allow them to lie with them at night! The Bengal cat only has an average life expectancy of 12 to 18 years, so you should set aside time each day to play with the pet.
- Playtime with your cat is very important. Cats love moving objects. You can tie the feathers to the string and move slowly across the floor. This will make Bengal think that this is a living animal. Pull slowly, shaking from back to front until the Bengal cat catches it.

### 3.4 Help the Bengal cat connect with the entire family. 

Bengal cats often pay attention to a person and ignore those around them. To avoid this, when the cat is young, allow each family member to spend time playing, feeding, and grooming the cat. This makes the pet familiar to everyone.
- Consider having more cats so that Bengal can be a company. Bengal cats are often fussy at midnight, so if you don't want your cat to bother at night, you should have a cat. The second cat does not need to be of the same breed, it can be a feral cat, a ranch cat, or a cat you have previously raised.

> Advice
- Bengal cats love to drink tap water because they are born in the wild and often drink from rivers and streams. Always keep the tap open if your cat needs to drink water to make it feel at home!
- Sterilize for Bengal cats! Unless you're a breeder or want 50 more cats, you should have them spawned.

> Warning
- Make sure the Bengal Cat is allowed to live locally before adopting it! If the breed is banned and you unintentionally adopt it, it will be subject to euthanasia. This should NOT be the case with any cat breed.
