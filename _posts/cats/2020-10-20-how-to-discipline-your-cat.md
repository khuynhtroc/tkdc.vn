> When you love your cat so much, it can be difficult to discipline him. Even if a cat is spoiled, it can be so cute that you don't want to yell or point out where it is wrong. There may be times when cats drive you crazy, but all attempts to discipline your cat quickly fall apart. Even, you are confused "do not know if you are the owner of it, or is it your owner?" You can teach your cat to behave obediently if you use the right methods.

## 1. Prepare to discipline your cat

### 1.1 Realize complexity. 

Training your cat can be either easy or difficult. Dogs are usually more willing to please their owners, so they are generally easier to train than cats in general. However, cats can also be trained if you understand how cats think and interact with people. Training your cat takes a lot of patience, and the hardest part is motivating your cat. 

![Discipline-Cats-Step-2]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-discipline-your-cat/v4-728px-Discipline-Cats-Step-2-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.2 Find a motivating factor for your cat. 

Every cat will love something that thanks to it, the cat will listen to you. The bottom line is what motivates the cat. That will usually be a treat that cats love. For some cats, it would be a piece of tuna, for some cats it would be cooked chicken.
- Whatever food you eat, hold it in your hand, and reward your cat as soon as the cat obeys you.
- Never hit the cat if the cat does not follow you. The cat will be angry at you for that and will stop listening to you.

### 1.3 Love your cat. 

The first step in disciplining your cat is getting the cat to obey. This will not happen if you cannot establish a warm and loving relationship with your cat. That situation would be extremely stressful. It is important to have a good relationship with your cat in the first place. This will ensure that your cat respects you, wants to please you, and obeys your commands.
- If you've just adopted a cat, pay extra attention to the cat. Take the time to cuddle if your cat accepts it. If not, try talking and petting as much as possible, and rewarding your cat with food from time to time. This can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, depending on how long it will take the cat to get used to you and the new environment.

### 1.4 Spend time with the kitten. 

While it's important to disciplined a kitten right away when a cat is spoiled, take the time to learn about its personality. There may be a number of specific factors that affect your cat's response to your discipline practice. If you have a kitten, he will be angry, curious, and inexperienced. It takes longer for the kitten to know what is right or wrong, so be patient while the kitten is learning.
- On the other hand, keeping a kitten can also be an advantage. If you are the only owner the kitten has ever had, you can influence the cat's behavior even more.

### 1.5 Deal with older cats. 

If you've just adopted an adult cat, or if your disciplined cat has been adopted a long time ago and is now grown up, remember that it has its own personality. Your cat may be used to certain forms of discipline, and you will have to work harder to pinpoint right and wrong.
- However, an adult cat will likely be quiet, understand quickly, and be less resistant to it.

### 1.6 Examine your cat's past experiences. 

Before disciplining, think about your cat's life before being adopted by you. If your cat has been in a breeding facility, is well treated, well cared for, and well-fed, the cat will not have traumatic behavior in the past. If your cat is from a violent background or has been repeatedly beaten, you may need to put in more effort.
- Remember that adopted or abused cats will fear and suspect you - and their new environment, depending on past experiences with their former owners.

### 1.7 Pay attention to your cat's personality. 

A cat's personality can be as diverse and complex as its owner. Ask yourself a few questions to understand your cat's personality. What type of cat do you have? Do you find your cat shy, easy to please, lazy, or affectionate? Your cat's own personality can help you decide how to respond to specific situations.
- Frightened cats will need a gentle approach when it comes to discipline. You will need to make an effort to win over your cat's trust before disciplining her.
- An aggressive cat will need to be evaluated by an animal behavior specialist so that you won't get hurt trying to discipline the cat.

## 2. Train your cat

### 2.1 Provide the necessary supplies for your cat. 

To keep your cat in trouble, give her plenty of supplies to instinctively engage in the behavior. Cats love to run, bite, scratch, and explore nature, so you need to provide your cat with friendly toys to meet those needs. This will prevent many disciplinary problems from being satisfied by the cat. There are many ways you can meet the basic needs of a cat.
- Provide a nail polish column for your cat. Buy one or more nail poles and place them around the house so your cat can sharpen them. This will keep your cat from scratching your furniture, walls, or other objects.
- Buy a toy for your cat to chew and bite into. Chew toys, small balls, and stuffed mice can help your cat use its hunting instinct without biting or hurting you. They also prevent your cat from chewing on other household items.
- Create a space for your cat or indoor play tent so she can play all day. Cats love to jump, climb and explore, so give your cat a climbing system, or set up a "cat-friendly" corner in the house so she can play around without destroying her stuff. fixtures.

### 2.2 Reward good behavior. 

It is important to let your cat know when it has done well. This will help your cat understand that the behavior should be repeated. Good behaviors include: knowing how to use a sandbox properly, eating and drinking properly, scratching a nail column instead of raking things, playing with toys instead of playing with your toys. It is also important to do this regularly. Reward your cat for good behavior often to let her know she's doing it right. Treats are a popular way to reward cats. However, do not overdo it, as rewarding food can cause your cat to gain weight.
- You can also reward by paying attention to the cat. Talking to your cat in a gentle voice, petting, or snuggle are all ways to let her know that you truly appreciate her actions.

### 2.3 Play with your cat. 

One way to help your cat for good behavior and also to reward your cat is to play together. When you are indoors, bring out an interactive toy that requires you to play. For example, many cats love to play with feathers or shiny objects tied to sticks. Make time to play with your cat whenever possible. Your cat will be able to exercise and feel loved by its owner.
- Another option is to use a laser pen. Some cats love to play with the laser pen, and you can point the pen everywhere and still be able to sit still in the chair. Some people think the game is not suitable because cats will never actually "catch" the red laser dot, while others argue that being chased is important.

## 3. Disciplining your cat

![Discipline-Cats-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-discipline-your-cat/v4-728px-Discipline-Cats-Step-11.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Use a special tone. 

At times, cats will have behaviors that require discipline. Just as important as letting the cat know when the cat is doing the right thing, you need to show the cat what she is not doing. You have to do it consistently so that the cat knows the behavior is bad. Use a special tone when the cat is not good. There is no need to scream as it will scare the cat. Instead, use a stern tone of voice to let the cat know you've made a mistake. Your cat will immediately notice it when it is not doing well.
- To make it more effective, call the cat's name, for example, "Damn it!" with a stern tone. This will help your cat realize that he made a mistake, but the downside to this approach is that the cat may associate its name with bad behavior.

### 3.2 Get the cat out of a bad situation. 

There are two ways to get a cat out of a situation of bad behavior. You can isolate the cat. For example, if your cat is going to eat your food, you can put her in the bedroom while she is having dinner. While it can be painful to make a cat squealing, it will teach your cat that the behavior is not repeated.
- You can also remove the cat from the room after you've grabbed the cat's nape. If your cat resists, scratches, or bites you, you can grab the nape of the cat's nape and say "No!". If the cat is still spoiled, pick it up and move it to another room, still say no to the cat.
- Never lift a cat off the ground by grabbing the nape of the neck. That can hurt the cat and the cat will scratch you. Be aware that a cat bite can turn into a serious infection.

### 3.3 Use of water aversion. 

In order for your cat to stop doing certain things, you can splash a little water from the water bottle at the right time to prevent unwanted behavior. Such behaviors can either jump on the table or bite a tree. You have to act discreetly so that the cat won't know that you are the one who sprays the water. Splash the cat with water when the cat isn't looking at you or has her back facing you. Otherwise, the cat will contact you with the water and will warn or scare you after you splash the water at the wrong time.
- Some people think that the aversion remedy doesn't work for cats, but it can still work well depending on your cat.

### 3.4 Trapping. 

You can set up traps for your cat to prevent it from engaging in bad behavior. For example, if your cat often scratches the toilet paper roll, place an empty water bottle over the roll, so the water bottle will fall off and scare the cat while playing with the roll. If your cat likes to jump on the kitchen table, stick double-sided tape or aluminum foil on the table surface, so the cat will associate the counter with discomfort. Those tangible fears will make cats more disciplined.
- Use a cat repellent carpet you can afford, which will often generate a very light electric shock on the cat's paw each time the cat steps on it.

### 3.5 Always be consistent and consistent. 

No matter how you punish your cat, be consistent. Even if your cat is the cutest in the world, show that you are serious about the cat's bad behavior. You also need to be consistent. Every time your cat has a hard-to-accept behavior, you need to react quickly to let your cat know how to associate bad behavior with punishment. If you do not punish immediately and then do it later, the cat will not understand why the cat was punished and will be afraid of you.

> Advice
- Don't yell or be fierce. Your voice tone will affect your cat, even if the cat may not fully understand what you say.
- Do not provoke the cat in any way. Leave the cat alone while sleeping or hiding. Chasing a cat will cause an unwanted confrontation.
- Do not hit or throw objects at the cat. This will make your cat angry and afraid of you, and ruin a good relationship.
- If your cat is aggressive, talk to an animal behavior expert or veterinarian for advice.
- Never pick up an aggressive cat, as it may bite you. A cat bite can cause a serious infection. If you are bitten, see a doctor immediately.
- Don't be too rough with the cat, or you will be considered abusive.
