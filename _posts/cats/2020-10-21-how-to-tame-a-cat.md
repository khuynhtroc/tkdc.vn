title: "How to tame a cat?"
summary: To tame a feral cat, you will need as much time, knowledge, patience, and caution as possible. A feral cat is a domestic cat that has been domesticated but has to return to the wild and no contact with humans. If the cat seems healthy and you want to tame it, be aware that the cat may be scared and bite you. However, if you find or have been assigned to take care of a frightened stray cat, but the cat can tolerate human contact without scratching or biting, you can go for it. You may not be able to completely turn it back into a domestic cat, but it can become a docile pet. Sometimes, all you need is a lot of patience to turn a scared cat into an adorable pet. The first goal is to make the cat feel comfortable around you. After that, the cat must be taken to a physical examination to make sure it is not sick.

## 1. Observe the cat's nature

![Tame-a-Cat-Step-1]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-tame-a-cat/v4-728px-Tame-a-Cat-Step-1-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 1.1 Understand your cat's personality. 

Observe the cat for a few days. That way, you can determine the nature of the cat, especially when approached by humans. Are cats shy or afraid of humans? Is the cat angry?
- If you find that the cat is dangerous, don't try to approach it. Instead, call the animal control team or a humanitarian organization because only they can professionally capture and approach a feral cat.

![Tame-a-Cat-Step-2]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-tame-a-cat/v4-728px-Tame-a-Cat-Step-2-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 1.2 Observe your cat's body language. 

Cats show emotions clearly in body language. Example:
- An angry or frustrated cat may have its ears closed, pupil enlargement, tail wagging, back arching, and upright hair. Usually, the cat will growl. It is a sign that you should step away.
- If the cat does not run away, the cat will either lie on the ground or put its tail between its legs after fear. Be careful when tame such cats.
- Conversely, a calm cat will straighten its ears forward to listen, and the tail will also be facing the sky. This cat's fur will be in a normal state. The cat may still be stretched, lying down, or rolling back and forth. 

![Tame-a-Cat-Step-3]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-tame-a-cat/v4-728px-Tame-a-Cat-Step-3-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 1.3 Monitor your cat's general health. 

Even if you can't get close enough, you can still observe the cat's health from afar. Check if the cat is skinny or emaciated. Maybe the cat is starving. Observe the coat to see if the cat is healthy or not. If the coat appears frayed, sheds a lot, or has areas of hair loss, the cat may be sick. Look for any other problems your cat has, such as limping, cuts, bumps, etc.

### 1.4 Stay away from cats with suspected rabies. 

Wild cats are often not vaccinated and are at risk of getting the rabies virus. Although very rare, rabies in cats usually occurs mainly in domesticated and unvaccinated cats. The symptoms of rabies can be diverse and take months to show up after a cat becomes infected with the rabies virus.
- Typical signs of rabies in cats include sickness (drowsiness, anorexia, weakness) and/or behavior changes (aggression, hyperactivity, disorientation, paralysis, convulsions).
- If you encounter a cat with these symptoms, call the animal control team and don't try to approach.

## 2. Let the cat adjust to your presence

![Tame-a-Cat-Step-5]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-tame-a-cat/v4-728px-Tame-a-Cat-Step-5-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Introduce your cat to your voice. 

If your cat seems easy to tame, the next step will be to get it accustomed to your presence and your voice. Sit up close and talk to your cat in a soft, comfortable voice.

![Tame-a-Cat-Step-6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-tame-a-cat/v4-728px-Tame-a-Cat-Step-6-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Give your cat dry or wet food. 

While you are talking, let the cat eat some food. You should do this for about three days. In the meantime, do not rush to try to interact with the cat.
- After three days, observe your cat's positive body language to see if she feels comfortable in your presence. A satisfied cat will straighten its ears, tail, and arch its back. Your cat's fur should be normal and the cat will be able to purr.

![Tame-a-Cat-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-tame-a-cat/v4-728px-Tame-a-Cat-Step-7-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Try approaching the cat with food. 

Use a spoonful of wet food or canned tuna and hold it to the cat. Name or call "kitty!". If the cat hisses, it means the cat is frightened and it will take more time to get used to your presence. Take the time to help your cat feel comfortable eating and drinking with you.

![Tame-a-Cat-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-tame-a-cat/v4-728px-Tame-a-Cat-Step-8.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 Watch for signs of aggression. If your cat shows any signs of aggression, such as growling or screaming, give the cat more time to get to know you. You might also consider calling an animal control team.

![Tame-a-Cat-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-tame-a-cat/v4-728px-Tame-a-Cat-Step-9.jpg.webp)

### 2.5 Use a cat pheromone product. 

If you need help making your cat more comfortable, you can use cat pheromone products. It's a compound that mimics the pheromone scent in cats to help calm the cat. You can spray the product in the area around your cat. However, be aware that the sound when spraying can make your cat scared or angry.
- There is also a liquid pheromone product that you can apply to certain areas. You can also try a diffuser if the cat is in an enclosed area.

![Tame-a-Cat-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-tame-a-cat/v4-728px-Tame-a-Cat-Step-10.jpg.webp)

### 2.6 Pet the cat with a spoon. 

Look for a long wooden spoon or spatula. Wrap the soft cloth around it. The fur is also very effective. Gently bring the spoon close enough to touch the cat without agitating it. While the cat is eating, slowly bring out the spoon to petting it. It may take a few tries over a few days before the cat gets used to this.
- If the cat runs away, don't chase it. You can pet the cat later.

## 3. Get in contact with your cat

![Tame-a-Cat-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-tame-a-cat/v4-728px-Tame-a-Cat-Step-11.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Wear long clothes to protect the body. 

Before you can take your cat for a checkup, it is best to wear long clothes to protect your body when you interact with the cat. Wear thick gloves, long sleeves, and pants to minimize the risk of getting scratched or bitten.

![Tame-a-Cat-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-tame-a-cat/v4-728px-Tame-a-Cat-Step-12.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Use your hands to pet the cat. 

After you've been petting the cat with a spoon for a while, try running your hand under the spoon to petting the cat. Just stroke the cat's shoulder and head.
- Do not touch anywhere near the cat's belly. A cat can become defensive if it feels threatened. Only when your cat completely trusts you will you be able to pet its stomach.

![Tame-a-Cat-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-tame-a-cat/v4-728px-Tame-a-Cat-Step-13.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Try picking up the cat.

Use a towel or blanket to pick up the cat. Do this after you've petted the cat a few times. Choose a time when your cat seems relaxed and comfortable.
- Getting to this stage can take a long time. This depends on that cat. Some cats will never become pure enough to be picked up.
- If the cat struggles when you are picked up, let it go. Otherwise, you will be bitten or scratched. Also, you may have to try all over again if you encounter this situation.

## 4. Take the cat to the vet

![Tame-a-Cat-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-tame-a-cat/v4-728px-Tame-a-Cat-Step-14.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Help your cat get used to the carrier. 

The cat will need to be placed in a carrier in order to reach the vet. You will need to give your cat time to get used to the cage.
- Keep the cage door open in the house so the cat can explore it on her own.
- Place the food in front of the cage so that the cat will be interested in learning. 
- Move the food into the cage so that the cat will step inside.

![Tame-a-Cat-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-tame-a-cat/v4-728px-Tame-a-Cat-Step-15.jpg.webp)

### 4.2 Take the cat to the vet. 

If you are able to come into contact with the cat, bring it to the vet as soon as possible. There, the cat can be properly examined, vaccinated, and treated.
- Cats need to be vaccinated to avoid many diseases, such as leukemia. Ask your veterinarian about the necessary vaccines.

![Tame-a-Cat-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-tame-a-cat/v4-728px-Tame-a-Cat-Step-16.jpg.webp)

### 4.3 Ask your doctor about ways to get rid of lice and deworming. 

Since cats can be feral for a long time, they need to be treated for lice and parasites. Your veterinarian can use topical treatments or advise you to do other things at home.

![Tame-a-Cat-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-tame-a-cat/v4-728px-Tame-a-Cat-Step-17.jpg.webp)

### 4.4 Get the cat to be spayed. 

One of the best ways to help your cat is to have it sterilized to prevent abandonment of the kitten. The vet will remove a small piece of the ear, and this is a painless procedure performed once the cat is sedated. The pointed tip of the cat's ear will be removed. This will indicate that the cat has been sterilized.

## 5. Help the stray kitten get acquainted with people

![Tame-a-Cat-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-tame-a-cat/v4-728px-Tame-a-Cat-Step-18.jpg.webp)

### 5.1 Tame a kitten when it is 4 to 8 weeks old. 

When a kitten begins to wean, it will be easier to domesticate. This is when the kitten becomes independent from the mother cat. Once a kitten is familiar with humans, it will be suitable for adoption.

![Tame-a-Cat-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-tame-a-cat/v4-728px-Tame-a-Cat-Step-19.jpg.webp)

### 5.2 Provide the kitten with a safe haven. 

When you are not training the kitten to get acquainted with people, give the kitten a small, quiet room for it to relax. It could be a bathroom or an unused room.
- Turn on the night light overnight to prevent the room from getting dark.

![Tame-a-Cat-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-tame-a-cat/v4-728px-Tame-a-Cat-Step-20.jpg.webp)

### 5.3 Choose the right location. 

It can be very effective if you practice getting the kitten to get to know people where there is a lot of traffic. You can try doing it in the yard, where someone else is working or playing. If not, you can train your cat in a similar indoor location.

![Tame-a-Cat-Step-21]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-tame-a-cat/v4-728px-Tame-a-Cat-Step-21.jpg.webp)

### 5.4 Get down on the same level as the kitten.

Do not stand tall by the side of the kitten. Sit down on the floor.

![Tame-a-Cat-Step-22]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-tame-a-cat/v4-728px-Tame-a-Cat-Step-22.jpg.webp)

### 5.5 Give the kitten wet food. 

As long as the kitten is healthy, you can use food to help the kitten get to know people. This way, you can get your cat closer to you because it is hungry and wants to eat the food you have. Sit next to the kitten while it is eating.
- You can also place the cat's plate on your lap to keep the cat even closer to you.
- Take the food away when you leave. This way, the cat will relate to you with the food.

![Tame-a-Cat-Step-23]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-tame-a-cat/v4-728px-Tame-a-Cat-Step-23.jpg.webp)

### 5.6 Let the cat lick the food from your hand. 

Once your cat has gotten used to your presence at mealtimes, offer her some food in hand. You can use wet cat food or baby food (choose beef or chicken flavors).
- A kitten may eat food instead of lick it because that is the natural way to eat it. The kitten may also bite you lightly on your finger while eating.

![Tame-a-Cat-Step-24]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-tame-a-cat/v4-728px-Tame-a-Cat-Step-24.jpg.webp)

### 5.7 Start petting the kitten. When the kitten is hungry and wants to eat, try gently petting it. You can start by petting the cat's head and shoulders only.

If the cat runs away, repeat the previous step a little longer.

![Tame-a-Cat-Step-25]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-tame-a-cat/v4-728px-Tame-a-Cat-Step-25.jpg.webp)

### 5.8 Move to the stage of caressing without food. 

Once the cat gets used to your presence and petting, you will need to remove the food from the process. This will ensure that the cat still likes to be petted even if it is no longer fed. Try petting the cat after it has eaten it.

![Tame-a-Cat-Step-26]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-tame-a-cat/v4-728px-Tame-a-Cat-Step-26.jpg.webp)

### 5.9 Slowly help the cat get acquainted with other people. 

If you are tame a cat for someone else to adopt, you need to make sure that the cat will get to know people other than you.
- Begin allowing them to approach the kitten one by one. They should also begin to feed the kittens on a plate first and then use their hands to feed them. Kittens will get used to their voice, scent, and gestures.

> Advice
- Don't touch your cat's belly, tail, and paws before she knows you won't hurt him. These are very sensitive areas, and your cat may scratch or bite you.
- Go slowly. You may have to do this process more slowly if you intend to help the cat step out of its "comfort zone".

> Warning
- If your cat is aggressive, stay away for a while.
- Only people who have been trained to handle feral cats should approach them.
- If you have been bitten by a cat (domestic cat or feral cat), see your doctor treat the bite right away. Carefully take care of your cat's scratches to make sure they don't get infected.
