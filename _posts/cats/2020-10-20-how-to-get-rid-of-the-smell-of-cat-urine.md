## 1. Clean up your cat's urine

### 1.1 Pat the cat's urine on the carpet with a towel. 

Try to blot as dry as possible. This step will make your job easier. Use a clean tissue and apply pressure to the urine. Continue to change the paper towels until no more absorbent.
- Skip this step if the urine is already dry.
- You can use an old towel or a disposable towel instead of a tissue. Cotton towels of moderate thickness will absorb more. Use a white towel if available. When you no longer see the yellow streak seeping into the towel, all your cat's urine has been absorbed.

### 1.2 Use an enzyme cleaning solution. Enzyme cleaners like Nature's Miracle, which contain special bio-enzymes that can break down protein molecules in urine, reduce odors, and even remove odors. 

Note that the enzyme cleaning solution may not work if you have used other chemicals to treat the stain before. In general, you should first try a watering enzyme cleaner where you need to treat it. Follow the manufacturer's instructions and wait several days to dry. You probably won't have to do anything more.

### 1.3 Make a vinegar solution. 

If the enzyme cleaner doesn't get rid of all the smells, use a vinegar solution. Mix white vinegar with the same amount of water in a bowl or spray bottle. Water or spray the solution onto the stain, spraying the stain a bit to ensure complete cleaning of urine.
- With a black light or a UV light, you will see the urine light up in the dark and you can pinpoint the exact location of the spot.

### 1.4 Use the vinegar solution to scrub the stain. 

Use a stiff brush to scrub thoroughly with the vinegar/water mixture until the stain is soaked with water. The vinegar will neutralize the smell of ammonia in your cat's urine.

### 1.5 Blot the stain thoroughly. 

Now use a clean paper towel or rag to soak the vinegar solution as dry as possible. After absorbing, let the air dry completely.

### 1.6 Clean off hard surfaces. 

Clean the stain with an ammonia-free household cleaner. In dogs and cats, ammonia smells like urine. Use water to clean it. Mix ten parts water with one part bleach into a spray bottle. Put on gloves and spray on the dirty areas. Leave the bleach water for 30 seconds, then wipe it off with a wet rag.
-Be careful with bleach as it can damage or discolor some materials.

### 1.7 Check clothes for urine. 

If your clothes are stained with urine, add 1 cup (60 ml) of apple cider vinegar to your regular laundry detergent. If urine still smells, add a little enzyme cleaning solution.
- Dry cleaning may be required. If you can't remove all the odors or remove the stain from something, you must throw it away.

## 2. Deodorizing Dirty place

### 2.1 Sprinkle baking soda on the stain. 

Baking soda, also known as sodium bicarbonate, is a natural cleaning agent, as well as a deodorant and deodorant.

### 2.2 Mix a small amount of hydrogen peroxide and dish soap. 

Dissolve ½ cup (120 ml) of 3% hydrogen peroxide with 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of dishwashing liquid and sprinkle it on the area where baking soda was sprinkled.
- You may need to test this solution on a blind spot to make sure it does not discolor the materials.

### 2.3 Use a scrub brush to mix the solution with baking soda. 

Make sure to use rubber gloves if you have one, and then wait for the baking soda and hydrogen peroxide to react to foam and take effect.

### 2.4 Absorb all the water in the treatment area and let the mixture dry.

### 2.5 Vacuuming. 

Vacuuming the area to be handled can remove urine particles and deodorants. In this case, you should use a water vacuum cleaner because you can water the carpet and then suck it back into the machine's container. But if you don't have one, you can use a regular vacuum cleaner; just not as efficient as a water vacuum cleaner.
- For best results when using a water vacuum cleaner, use cool water in the vacuum cleaner container and always follow the manufacturer's instructions.
- Avoid using steam cleaners as high temperatures can cause stains.

### 3. Reduced Chance of an Incident

### 3.1 Retrain your cat. 

Never scold or punish a cat for peeking. Instead, quickly lift the cat into its sand tray. Repeatedly lift the cat into the tray and encourage it each time the cat is pooping in. This will strengthen the connection between the tray and the cat's pee.

### 3.2 Change your cat's litter tray often. 

Cats love clean litter boxes as much as people like clean baths. If it's time to replace your cat's litter tray and you just ignore its needs, then your cat will have a hard time peeking out on your sofa or carpet.
- Place the cat's litter box in a quiet place and not close to the feeding area. This increases the cat's ability to use its litter tray.

### 3.3 Consider spaying your cat. 

A sterilized cat will not intentionally use urine to mark its territory, thus solving the immediate problem for you. Plus, you no longer have to raise kittens to poop in the right place!

### 3.4 Take the cat to the vet for a checkup. 

If the problem occurs frequently, especially in young or old pets, there may be health problems if you notice your pet is urinating normally. Contact your veterinarian and discuss possible causes of your cat to pee outside of its litter box. If you ignore your cat's problems like urinary tract infections, kidney problems, or diabetes, they could be life-threatening.

> Advice
- If your carpets, upholstery, and curtains are expensive, consult a professional treatment to avoid damaging your furniture.
- Be prepared for the trouble of bringing a new cat home. You need to train your cat to poop in the right place, pay attention to cleaning it up if it gets messed up, and treat your cat if the illness prevents him from going to the toilet in the right place.
- If you are tired of constantly following cat cleaning or are afraid that your cat's urine will soak your carpet and seep through the wooden floor, call a professional. It will definitely cost more, but it will also be more efficient.
- Dogs and cats can smell the smell even if we don't smell anything and they can go back to pee where the urine was before. You need to use an enzyme cleaner like Nature's Miracle to remove the smell of your urine.

> Warning
- Do not mix ammonia-containing products with bleach as it can cause a dangerous reaction. [8]
