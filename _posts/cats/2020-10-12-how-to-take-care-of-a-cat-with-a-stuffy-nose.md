## How to take care of a cat with a stuffy nose?

## 1.	Caring for your cat at home

### 1.1 Watch for signs of inflammation. 

Inflammation in the cat's nose is called rhinitis, while inflammation in the nasal cavity is called sinusitis. Both of these conditions can lead to a stuffy nose and symptoms such as:
- Sneeze
- Runny nose
- Stuffy nose
- Anorexia

### 1.2 Be aware of the common causes of a stuffy nose.

Many factors can cause a cat to have rhinitis or sinus infections and lead to a stuffy nose. Some of the most common causes include allergies, nasal lumps, foreign objects stuck in the nasal cavity, parasites, fungal infections, tooth abscesses, and viral or bacterial infections.

### 1.3 Check for signs of an upper respiratory infection. 

Most of the stuffy nose in cats is caused by the herpes viruses and caliciviruses. Signs of a cat infection include a clear or cloudy runny nose on both sides of the nose and discharge in the eyes.

### 1.4 Let the symptoms of upper respiratory tract inflammation go away on their own.

Inflammatory disease of the upper respiratory tract has some characteristic symptoms such as sneezing, watery eyes, clear runny nose and cough. If you suspect your cat has a stuffy nose due to a normal upper respiratory tract infection, you can let it go away on its own. The symptoms usually don't last long and the cat should go away on its own within 7 to 10 days.

### 1.5 Clean your cat's nose often. 

You can help your cat keep her nose clean to help with a stuffy nose. Soak a cotton ball with water and gently wipe off the mucus secreted from the cat's nose several times a day.

### 1.6 Try a steam bath. 

This can be very helpful if your cat has a chronic stuffy nose. The hot steam will dilute mucus from the nose and nasal cavity, making it easier for your cat to breathe. Take the cat into the bathroom, close the door, turn on the hot water through the shower and sit in it with the cat for about 10 minutes.

### 1.7 See veterinarian. 

If your cat is having trouble breathing, make an appointment with your vet. Your vet will do oral exams, blood tests, and / or physical exams to determine the cause of your cat's stuffy nose.

## 2.	Healthcare

### 2.1 Check for possible infection. 

This usually occurs because of another cause, such as a viral infection, a tumor or polyp in the nasal passages, or a foreign object stuck in the nose. When infected, cats often have a thick runny nose that resembles pus in both nostrils.
- If your cat has a yellow, green, or pus-like runny nose, antibiotic treatment may be needed.
- Check with your veterinarian if your cat needs antibiotics to treat the infection. Sometimes it's better to take care of your cat only to aid in the treatment of infection than to take antibiotics because overuse of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance.

### 2.2 Look for fungal infection. 

Cats can have a stuffy nose due to a fungal infection, with Cryptococcus the most common. When you have a fungal infection, your cat's face may become disproportionately and s ollen. Your cat will also experience a runny nose that is bloody or pus-like. 
- Your veterinarian will treat your cat with an antifungal medication.
- For example, cats infected with Cryptococcus are often treated with fluconazole, itraconazole, or amphotericin B.

### 2.3 Make sure the cat is not trapped by a foreign object in its nose. 

It is not uncommon for cats to have certain objects such as nuts, grass leaves or gravel stuck in their nasal passages. This causes the cat to get stuffy, scratch her face often and / or sneeze a lot, and runny nose only on one side, not the two.
- Instead of handling it yourself, let the vet remove the object stuck in the cat's nose.
