> Bathing a cat is extremely difficult, but when you have a stubborn kitten in your hand, it is a real challenge. Although cats can clean themselves, sometimes bathing them is necessary if they have just played with something that smells unpleasant or if their coat is greasy and needs care. Cats need a lot of love and affection to trust them, especially if you shower them for the first time. So, how do you bathe your cat without panicking or avoid being scratched? See Step 1 to find out.

## 1. Prepare

![11713-1]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bathe-cats/v4-728px-11713-1.jpg.webp)

### 1.1 Determine a good time to bathe your cat. 

It is a fact that most cats do not need to bathe, as they are masters at grooming and hygiene. However, if your cat has fleas, has recently played in a sticky puddle, or it just looks a little dirty, then it's time to bathe it. If the cat is too young, just wipe it with a wet towel instead of bathing it.
- Consult with your veterinarian about the right time to bathe your kitten. According to the Animal Compassion Network, you should wait until the kittens are at least 8 weeks old before putting them in the bath.
- One benefit of bathing your cat as a child is to help her get used to bathing if she gets dirty frequently. Just remember that cats spend about 30% of their time grooming and should not bathe more than once or twice a year unless they are really dirty.

### 1.2 Trim your cat's nails. 

Even the meek kittens will resist a bit when you bathe them, especially if it's the first time. To protect yourself from scratches, it is a good idea to trim your cat's claws so that the cat is less likely to hurt you while bathing her. Although the scratches caused by a kitten are not as serious as an adult cat, you may still be injured. Take this step to keep yourself safe, even if your kitten resists the act.
- You should not trim your cat's claws right before bathing. Instead, do it the day before or at least a few hours before. A lot of cats are angry and angry after the claw has been trimmed, and it's important to keep the kitten calm before you start bathing.
- If you haven't trimmed your cat's claws yet, extend the time between clipping and bathing - even a day. Nail pruning can be a new and terrifying experience for a young kitten, and you won't want to make things worse by bathing them right after.

### 1.3 Groom your cat. 

Before bathing them, you should brush off the fur. The feathers on the legs, abdomen, and top of the head are where brushing is needed. This step is important to keep their hair from getting tangled and knotted. If you put your cat in the bath but haven't groomed it, this will make the knot more tangled and cause unnecessary trouble. Don't skip this important step.
- Some cats enjoy being groomed and see this as a relaxation process. However, some other cats panic or get agitated by brushing. If this step doesn't relax your cat, then give her at least an hour or two to calm down before bathing. Treating your cat after grooming contributes to a better bath.

### 1.4 Does not bathe your cat in a sleeveless and breasted tank top. 

Wear long-sleeved shirts with thick fabric instead, so that cats are less likely to scratch them. Some people claim that you even have to protect your hand, but this should only be done if the cat likes to bite and scratch. So you should always be safe for yourself, and wear a long-sleeved shirt to avoid scratching your arm.
- You should also wear thick cotton clothing so that your cat's claws won't get in the way. Should choose hard fabric material that is difficult to penetrate sharp objects.

### 1.5 Prepare your cat's shampoo. 

Kittens need special baby shampoo, and cats with fleas need a flea-killing shampoo, flea eggs, etc. For cats without fleas, you can use a regular cat shampoo. Go to a pet store, see a veterinarian, or buy it from an online retailer. If in doubt, ask the salesman for information about the best shampoos. Don't bathe your cat with regular soap or shampoo, or you will injure or irritate her skin.
- Do not use dog bath oils. It is important to use a design tailored to your cat's needs.

### 1.6 Gets the equipment ready to bathe your cat.

Once you've completed your preparations, fill the shift with water, and prepare a towel to dry the cat. Prepare the shampoo. If you have one more person to help, it would be even better! Instead of putting the cat in the bath and running for shampoo, it is advisable to have everything ready before bathing them.
- You can also close the bathroom door so the cat won't run out.

### 1.7 Make the bath more appealing to cats. 

If the cat is unfamiliar with bathing and the outside world, it should help ease the fear of being bathed. You can take their favorite toy in the tub or basin, or turn the bathroom into a fun place, and the cat won't think this is a scary place anymore. You can even play with your cat in a tub or tub without water at first so that he or she will feel comfortable in that environment.
- When it's time to bathe your cat, you can put in her favorite toy tub, or some bath toy, to make her feel comfortable. You can even let your cat play with toys in the tub dry at first.

### 1.8 Bathe your cat when he's calm. 

This is a very important point. Do not bathe them right after playing for half an hour and making them angry, or after being excited when you notice bugs in your room. Avoid bathing your cat right before a meal, or he will be agitated and anxious, wanting to eat instead of bathing. Instead, choose a time when the cat is calm, resting, or just relaxing and doesn't need anything 
- While the cat will get naturally aroused quite quickly, it is better to start with a calm cat to make it easier for herself and your cat to go through non-difficult bathing.
- You can also schedule a tiring play session and then wait half an hour for the cat to feel tired and rest before bathing.

## 2. Take a shower

![Bathe-a-Kitten-Step-6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bathe-cats/v4-728px-v4-728px-Bathe-a-Kitten-Step-6.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Prepare to bathe your cat. 

The most common places to bathe your cat are the washbasin or sink because bathing your cat in a small tub is easier and manageable. So do not let the cat go into the tub as it will make it difficult for them to bathe. Although some people like to fill the sink with water and "dip" the cat in, this will only frighten them, so only do this as a last resort. Instead, place the cat in the tub and slowly pour warm water over her.
- You can place a plastic pad on the bottom of the tub to keep your cat from slipping over.
- Some people like to fill the tub with about 2.5 cm of warm water so that the cat's paws will get used to the water before bathing. If you want, you can do this to pre-groom your cat. If your cat is genuinely afraid of the water, get closer to it to lessen it.

![Bathe-a-Kitten-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bathe-cats/v4-728px-v4-728px-Bathe-a-Kitten-Step-7.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Keep the cat calm. 

The cat can cling to everything to stay away from the bath. Just put them down gently, with one foot, then put the other feet down. Return the cat to the sink. You can gently hold the front shoulder and use your other hand to wash the cat's hair while holding the lower part. Talk to your cat gently and gently, and your kitten will feel calmer and more reassuring. If you start to lose your temper, the cat will sense that you are worried and will imitate your reaction.
- Cuddle the kitten while holding the back or shoulders tightly. If the cat brings the paws out of the tub, then you can keep them in this position instead of placing the entire body in the tub.

![Bathe-a-Kitten-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bathe-cats/v4-728px-v4-728px-Bathe-a-Kitten-Step-8.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Add water to the pot. 

While the cat is in the kitchen sink or sink, gently flush the warm water with a cup until the coat is completely wet. Pour the water slowly and gently, while cuddling and caressing the fur so that they feel calm. If you have someone to help you, that person can control the cat by holding the shoulder while you flush. Each flush should be between half and a full glass, and avoid splashing water on their faces. 
- Alternatively, you can fill the sink with water and put the cat in it. If you do this, first put the kitten in warm water until the feet are completely wet, praise them, and then immerse deeply in the water. If you do this, however, fill the tub with water while your kitten is in another room, because some cats are scared of the sound of running water.

![Bathe-a-Kitten-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bathe-cats/v4-728px-v4-728px-Bathe-a-Kitten-Step-9.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 Use shampoo to cleanse your cat's body. 

Pour a small amount of shampoo, rub it on your hands, and start applying it on your cat's back. Then apply on the tail, hind legs, front legs, and neck. Alternatively, you can also apply shampoo on the lower abdomen. If your kitten doesn't like the process, you can wash a small portion first, rinse it with water, and repeat the process. You won't want to apply the shampoo all over the cat's body and then won't be able to rinse it off before the cat runs out of the sink. You can use your hands or a towel to clean the cat.
- You should gently apply shampoo on the cat's coat and entire body. Treat it like baby hair and avoid stroking strong hairs. Be gentle and gentle and your kitten will be more relaxed.
- Cats may not really like shampoo. Just reassure your cat and help calm him down by being calmer.
- Do not let the shampoo get into the cat's eyes. You don't want them to get hurt while bathing.

![Bathe-a-Kitten-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bathe-cats/v4-728px-v4-728px-Bathe-a-Kitten-Step-12.jpg.webp)

### 2.5 Clean your cat with warm water. 

After cleaning the kitten with shampoo, rinse it off with water. You can gently pour water over their body, wash their hair with your hands, and rinse off the soap. If the kitten is in the sink, open the cap to let the soapy water run down. Pour a little water over the cat's body until the shampoo is gone. For extra help, you can also use a wet washcloth and gently scrub your cat's body.
- Some cats are attracted to the tap. If your cat is not afraid of the tap water and you are bathing them in the sink, then you can use the tap to rinse your kitten.

![11713-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bathe-cats/v4-728px-11713-14.jpg.webp)

### 2.6 Wash your cat's face with water. 

You don't need to wash your cat's face with shampoo. Just rinse with water and their face will be clean and fresh. You can apply it to their face with a wet washcloth. Take care not to get the water in the cat's eyes and nose. Some cats do not like to touch their face, especially in the presence of water, so be as gentle as possible.
- Whatever you do, don't pour water on your face. By doing this they will panic.

## 3. Dry

![11713-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bathe-cats/v4-728px-11713-15.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Pat the cat dry. 

First, you can pat them dry before you wrap them. This will absorb less moisture and keep your cat from feeling wrapped in a wet towel. Just gently dry their face, body, and fur to make them feel a little more comfortable before being placed in a towel.
- Some people even use the lowest-temperature hairdryer to dry cats. You need to do the best for your cat. Some liked the dryer and others were terrified. If your kitten likes a hairdryer, you can set the lowest temperature and gently dry the coat like it's drying, taking care so that the kitten won't panic.

![Bathe-a-Kitten-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bathe-cats/v4-728px-v4-728px-Bathe-a-Kitten-Step-13.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Cover the cat with a large fur towel to dry.

After bathing, dry your cat promptly. Be aware that small animals can experience a drop in body temperature due to their damp coat, so it is important to dry them quickly, before using heat to dry them. The towel may make your cat feel afraid of sealing and maybe a bit frightened, but it's important to dry them. Your kitten will shake the water out of its coat, just like your dog will.
- If your cat has long hair, you should brush it after bathing to avoid tangling.

![Bathe-a-Kitten-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bathe-cats/v4-728px-v4-728px-Bathe-a-Kitten-Step-14.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Reward your cat. 

Then cuddle, cuddle, and kiss them. Your poor cat just went through one of the worst. Most cats hate water! (However, there are two breeds of cats that are not afraid of water, Turkish Van and Bengal.) Even when your cat is used to bathing, the initial experience is not easy, and you need to be aware of that.
- If you reward your cat after bathing, he or she will associate bathing with good things and will want to bathe more.

> Advice
- Dry the cat in a fixed place, or hide important papers. If they are released they will dry themselves with paper instead of a towel!
- Remember not to bathe your cat too much. Water will dry out their skin and hair! Twice per week is maximum!
- Bringing your cat's forefoot above the water allows him to feel in control. You can let them put their feet in the sink or bath. This will also prevent water from getting on your face and ears.
- Note: If you start bathing your cat as a child and incorporate interesting bathing ideas (like food or treats), they will get more interested in bathing as they grow up.
- If you don't qualify for cat shampoo, Johnson's baby shower shampoo can be used!
- Grasping your cat's nape (the flesh behind her neck) can help her relax when it is immersed in the water.
- Your cat will become agitated when it comes in contact with the water. Just stay calm and apply shampoo on your cat's fur. Then cuddle them to relax them.
- Using rubber gloves will help when you are cutting your cat's nails.
- For cats who stick their teeth in your hands while bathing, use 2 old gloves, or buy 2 new ones. After showering, put gloves in the washer and dryer for the next use. (Keep cat bathing gloves separate and gloves used to prepare meals).
- You can also use nylon or a harness to hold the cat.
- If your kitten is afraid of bathing, talk to it in a gentle voice to make sure nothing bad happens.
- Grab the nape of the cat's nape the same way the mother steals a kitten. They will immediately stop. This action will not hurt them.

> Warning
- If you have a lot of cats, chances are that the other cat will not recognize the cat you are bathing and whistling, since you have washed off their identity. Bathe the entire cat if possible. In any case, it will take days to regain that characteristic cat odor.
- Never put soap on your cat's face, but if it does, rinse it off quickly and if irritation persists, see your vet immediately.
- Bathing can pose a serious health risk to your cat. They can easily catch colds, due to contact with water and lose heat as the water evaporates from the bristles. If your cat is too dirty, consult a veterinarian. Either the soiling is harmful to the cat's health, in contact with the skin or if the soap is swallowed, a veterinarian's advice.
- Make sure you and your cat leave no soap marks!
- Avoid getting soap on your face, but if it does, get medical help.
