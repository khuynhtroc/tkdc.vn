> If you've just adopted a kitten, you may find it very active very quickly. Kittens and adult cats are nocturnal predators, so they will be more active at night. Kittens' plentiful energy makes cat owners complain about losing sleep because of them. Luckily, there are many things you can use to keep a kitten asleep all night.

## 1. Establish a sleep routine for your cat

### 1.1 Give your cat a break and encourage it to be active during the day. 

Usually, kittens, especially young cats, spend most of their day sleeping, but once they are awake they are full of energy. Let them sleep, and prepare a scratching post, toys, and objects for them to climb on when awake. If the kitten is bored during the day, it will be very active at night.
- Try to hide interesting, interactive toys when you are not actively playing with your cat. If you leave these toys on the floor all day, the cats will no longer be interested in them. Don't leave leashed toys outside, as it can be dangerous if the kitten is entangled in the leash.
- Playing puzzles is also a great pastime for cats. This game requires the cat to open a box to get the food contained inside.

### 1.2 Play in the evening to reduce your cat's energy. 

Cats are most active only at dusk, not all night. Playing with your cat every day at night, about an hour before bed, will help synchronize your cat's bedtime with yours.
- You can tie a toy to a rope and have your cat play tag, throw and ping pong, or chase the laser. Change toys constantly to keep play fun and make your cat combine stalking, chasing, pounce, and play with her "prey".
- Wake up the kitten if necessary. You won't have to work for too long as cats will quickly find that evening is a time to play and that night is a time for sleep

### 1.3 End of playtime. 

It's best to finish playing before your cat gets bored. First, take about five minutes of slow-paced play to reduce your cat's excitement. Then, find a way to make a clear signal to let your cat know that playtime is up, like letting your cat grab a super fun toy.
- If the kitten becomes extremely hyperactive at the end of playtime, distract it with a less enjoyable toy.

### 1.4 Feed your cat before bedtime. 

You should feed your cat protein-rich foods to meet its nutritional needs during the day. Wild cats go hunting, eating, and then sleeping; The time you let your cat play and eat should also simulate the sequence.
- If your kitten calls for food and wakes you up in the morning, instead of feeding the cat when it is about to go to bed, feed it right before you go to bed. This will reduce the amount of time your cat has to wait between meals.

### 1.5 Go to bed. 

Go to bed as usual and let your cat see this. Your cat will learn what activities are signs that it's time to sleep, and this will gradually become a habit.

### 1.6 Comfort your cat in a comfortable sleeping area. 

Turn off the lights and put the cat on her bed. Hopefully by this time the cat is tired and wants to sleep. If not, soothe it by petting or listening to "cat-for-cat" relaxing music that is available online. Repeat these activities every day so the cat can adjust to them.
- Cats are naturally observant and like to stay up high to observe indoor activities. An overhead bed is an ideal place to sleep if your cat is mature enough to climb it.

## 2. Deal with activities at night

### 2.1 Keep your cat in a separate room at night. 

You may love cats snuggling into sleep with you, but let the active kittens sleep in a separate room until they are mature enough or have adapted to your schedule.
- When it's time to go to bed, close the door and keep your cat out of the room. Your cat will probably scream and scratch in the door for a while, but as long as you don't give in, it will stop soon.
- If your cat scratches the door for too long, you can use something to prevent it from getting close to the door, like sticking double-sided tape near the door or placing a flexible plastic mat with the side of the spikes facing up.

### 2.2 Warm a kitten blanket. 

Kittens sometimes disturb their owners' sleep because they miss the warmth of their mother and siblings. If your cat wants to go to bed with, you can use the dryer to warm her blanket about 20 minutes before bedtime.

### 2.3 Store noisy toys. 

Sometimes the sound of an active kitten's toy is the most annoying thing. Take away your cat's toys to emphasize that night is not a time to play but for sleep. If your cat remains active at night, you can play with soft, noisy toys instead of hard toys or a shrill squeak.
- If you have space, keep toys that are quiet at night in a separate area of ​​your home. Choose an area with something distracting from the cat, such as playing a movie or soothing radio show or a window looking out into the open.

### 2.4 Follow the "do nothing" rule.

Paying attention to your active kitten will encourage her to continue with her behavior. If a kitten gets you so annoyed that you play with it, feed it or notice it, then the behavior will continue as it has trained you! The first few nights will be tough, but ignoring the cat is the best way to teach it that you can't always be ready to respond 24/7.
- While not a quick solution, this training method is important for future kittens. A kitten needs to learn early that it cannot ask to eat or play at any time of the day.

### 2.5 Disciplining your cat with love. 

It sounds contradictory, but if you ignore it and the cat continues to whine, give him a big hug. You may find your kitten disinterested in this act of over-loving, and that's a good thing because you don't need to reprimand and still make the kitten realize that she won't get what she wants. bother you at night.

### 2.6 Give your cat breakfast without waking up. 

Cats have shorter sleep cycles than humans, so even if your cat sleeps with you, it will probably wake up early and ask for breakfast. Worst of all, you wake up and feed it, because if you do, the cat will train you very quickly! Instead, leave some food out from the night before so that the cat can eat breakfast before you wake up.
- Consider buying a pet food dispenser at certain times. If the kitten knows that there will be food in her bowl at 7:00 am, she will no longer ask you to feed her but will wait by the bowl until the food appears.
- If your cat asks for food at night, you can set up an automatic feeder to feed your cat at night, then increase the time to 10 minutes later each night until the cat eats in the morning. 

## 2. Use veterinary methods

### 3.1 Cast or sterilize your cat. 

A cat that has not been spayed or spayed may also cause it to be overactive. Most veterinarians believe these procedures are safe for kittens 6 to 8 weeks old, as long as they reach a minimum weight of 0.9 kg. Castration or sterilization can correct the following behaviors (day and night): 
- A female cat can be in heat from around 4 months old. They tend to scream out loud, weird, rubbing against people and objects, and often find a way to sneak out.
- Males that are not castrated are more active and noisy than desexed males. They may also pee on furniture or be aggressive.

### 3.2 Watch for signs that your cat is sick. 

Cats can also have medical problems that make it difficult for them to sleep as humans do. If your kitten has any of the following symptoms, you should take it for a checkup:
- Choking too much at night is sometimes caused by pain in the cat.
- Aggressiveness most of the day and night can be caused by sleep deprivation or other disorders in your cat. Usually, a kitten will sleep for about 20 hours a day.
- An obedient cat that suddenly becomes overactive can be a sign of a thyroid disorder, although it's very rare in kittens. Your veterinarian can find out this through a blood test and will prescribe daily medication for your cat.

### 3.3 Try synthetic pheromones. 

Synthetic pheromone products contain pheromones like on the face of cats, pheromones are substances that cats release when they rub their face against objects to mark them. Unfortunately, there are not many qualitative studies on synthetic pheromones at present. While you're not sure what will be effective, you can try this remedy to see if your cat is calmer.
- Homeopathic therapies, including "flower treatment", are not scientifically grounded.

> Advice
- Raising a cat as a friend is also another way to keep the kitten happy and active during the day. Kittens get along pretty well when they get to know each other, but it's still a good idea to leave them alone for a few days. If adopting a previously abusive kitten or a kitten in aggressive behavior, you should first consult your veterinarian or animal behavior specialist.
- If you have a yard, build a bird's nest, or at least open the curtains so the kitten can see the outside world. 

> Warning
- Don't use violent punishment to train your cat. Animals do not respond positively to punishment and often do not understand why they are being punished. If you want the kitten to stop bothering you, you can lock it in the room for a while and let it play on its own.
- Most cats and kittens are lactose intolerant, making it uncomfortable to drink cow's milk. If you feed your cat or kitten with milk, choose a cat-specific formula.
