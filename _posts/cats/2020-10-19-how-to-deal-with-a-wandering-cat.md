## 1. Approach the cat or catch it

### 1.1 Distinguish between a feral and a pet. 

A stray or stray cat can either be shy or friendly, making it difficult to distinguish by its behavior. Wanderers often have messy and dirty fur or look thin or injured. If you can touch the cat, check the soles of its paws. Cats that have been wandering around for weeks outside will have hard, callous feet in comparison to the soft paws of your domestic pet.
- If the cat tries to run away, doesn't look at you, and doesn't meow in response, it is probably a feral cat and has never been raised as a pet.
- Look for stray cat notices on store windows and neighborhood power poles, newspapers, or local websites.
- In winter, you need to take a closer look. During this time wild animals need shelter and food, and pets seldom go out. You can easily track the animal with fresh traces of the snow if you wake up early before everyone leaves the house.

### 1.2 Try to approach the animal. 

If you think it is a wandering cat, approach it slowly and speak in a gentle voice. If the cat seems timid, try bending over it. Reach out a hand and sweetly call it. If that doesn't work, come back next time with a delicious treat like a piece of tuna or dried liver.
- Try using a variety of tones, as some cats respond with a high voice, others like low voices, even call "meow".
- Do not get too close if the cat seems nervous or anxious. Cats may bite or scratch if they feel cornered.

### 1.3 Check the cat's neck tag. 

If your cat has a tag and allows you to get close enough to read the number or address on the card, contact its owner to see if it has been released.
- Some cards only include the contact information for the veterinarian or clinic. The veterinarian may not be able to give you the pet owner's information, but they can pass the message.

![Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deal-with-a-wandering-cat/v4-728px-Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-10-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.4 Provide shelter, water, and catmint for the cat you think have been lost. 

This will probably help you keep it around until you can help it. Place the food outside late at night, in a space where the cat can get in but not in larger animals.
- When it gets cold, a little oil from the sardine can on the pellets will be effective.
- Do not place food outdoors until you suspect stray pets, otherwise, the food will only attract wildlife or other people's pets (they may be eating on a controlled diet. control).

![Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deal-with-a-wandering-cat/v4-728px-Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-12.jpg.webp)

### 1.5 Consider contacting a professional. 

If the cat is inaccessible, you can call the Animal Control Center or your local animal aid society to have them pick up. Find out their policy before calling, especially for cats not wearing a tag. Many places end cats that are not adopted. Some other places have a more humanitarian program called Trap - Cast - Release (TNR), so the cat will be released again without increasing the number of stray cats.
- Animal relief sites often provide wandering animals with a better life off the road. The cat will not starve, be injured, or be left outside.

![Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deal-with-a-wandering-cat/v4-728px-Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-13.jpg.webp)

### 1.6 Set the trap yourself. If you prefer to catch the cat yourself, buy the "humane" trap (cage trap) at the home store, or ask the animal control site if they can lend it. Use a leopard to cover the tin and the bottom of the trap to prevent the cat instinctively from stepping on the tin. Place the bait with a little smelly food. Canned herring, mackerel, or fish bait (not in vinegar) is very effective.

Do not install the tin lever is too sensitive. If the cat triggers the trigger early and escapes, it will never return. It's better to avoid the risk so you can reposition and try the trap again.
- Too much lure can cause dirt if your cat panics and starts to throw food around or vomit.
- In the cold, cover the traps with a towel or cloth, then place snow on top to keep the cat warm and calm it down when it is.

![Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deal-with-a-wandering-cat/v4-728px-Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-14.jpg.webp)

### 1.7 Check traps often, but be careful. 

Check the trap as often as possible, but approach it slowly to avoid frightening the cat. If the trap hasn't worked for a day or two, try a slower approach:
- Do not set traps.
- Every day at the same time (preferably late afternoon), take out the food near the trap.
- Gradually move food placement closer to the trap, finally placing it in the trap. If your cat doesn't get in the trap, try covering the trap with a towel with the cat's pheromone spray on it.
- When your cat is constantly eating in the trap, set it up.

![Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deal-with-a-wandering-cat/v4-728px-Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-16.jpg.webp)

### 1.8 Decide what to do when the cat has fallen. 

Once you have trapped your cat, contact your local animal shelter to ask about their rules. In some parts of the United States, you may have to take your stray pet there so the owner has a chance to find it. Depending on the response from the animal relief and the cat's expression, you may decide:
- If you are not going to have a cat, contact animal relief or animal control in advance to have the cat go. Leave the cat in the trap in a quiet, dark place while you wait. Minimize the amount of time your cat has to wait, as this is very stressful for animals.
- Wandering pets often have dirty fur, meow, and look human eyes. Eventually, it can ease the tension, head to the cage door, explore toys, or people coming up close.  Continue looking for a cat owner or decide to have a cat.
- A feral (not domesticated) cat is usually deep inside the cage, can shake or hit the wall of the cage, regardless of toys or people. Learn how to treat the animal and other methods to determine if it is truly a wild animal.

## 2. Take care of your stray cat

![Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deal-with-a-wandering-cat/v4-728px-Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-17.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Be extra careful when approaching the cat. 

Even a friendly cat often panic when caught in a trap. Wear thick gloves when approaching the cat, and have a towel or blanket to throw on the cat if it wants to attack you. If possible, avoid grabbing it; whether you avoid scratching or biting the cat will hate the person who caught it.
If absolutely necessary, move the cat to another cage in the following way:
- Place the cage upright with the entrance facing up.
- Stand behind the cat and grasp the nape with your dominant hand.
- Quickly press on the cat's back with your other hand until you can hold both of its hind legs.
- Reach out as far away from the body as possible, lift the cat and put the cat in the cage and the tail first.
- Quickly close the cage door above the cat. Press down on the door with one hand and clamp the cage between the legs until the door latches securely.

![Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deal-with-a-wandering-cat/v4-728px-Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-20.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Prepare a safe place for your cat. 

Ideally, the room should be sealed to prevent the cat from escaping, quiet, unused, easy to clean, and virtually empty. You can use the spare bathroom or the hallway corner. Book the following items in the room:
- A comfortable seat for you to sit quietly while your cat gets used to it.
- A comfortable hiding spot and a good view of the cat's room. A cat cage with a high wall is fine.
- Country
- Cat litter box
- You can also add a scratching post or toy room, although the cat may be too stressed out to play.

![Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deal-with-a-wandering-cat/v4-728px-Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-19.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Release the cat carefully. 

Wear gloves and keep the trap or cage away when releasing the cat. Most likely the cat will run quickly into a hiding place, but some others will try to escape.
- Close the door. Cats are very agile and can leap past you to exit the door.

![Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-21]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deal-with-a-wandering-cat/v4-728px-Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-21.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 Separate the cat from other animals in the house. 

A room where cats are safe should have no access to other pets, including the doorway, as animals can smell each other and pathogens can be transmitted this way. Change your shoes and clothes, wash your hands, and any skin areas that have been in contact with the cat every time you leave the room to avoid infecting other pets in the house.
- Cats can also transmit diseases to humans. If you are bitten by a cat, wash the wound with soap and water, and immediately consult your doctor about the risk of rabies, a fatal disease if vaccinated is not timely. If you get scratched by your cat, immediately wash it with soap and water, see your doctor if the skin is red or swollen, or if the glands are swollen, have headache, fever, or exhaustion.

![Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-22]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deal-with-a-wandering-cat/v4-728px-Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-22.jpg.webp)

### 2.5 Let the cat calm down for a few hours. 

Once your cat is less frightened, step into the room gently, bringing with you food and a camera. Try to observe the cat closely, it is best to take a clear picture so that you can start looking for its owner.
- It is less likely that the cat will become aggressive, but leave immediately if you notice any of the following signs: the ears are pressed against the head or the pupils are very large; curled up to get momentum, tense posture; or approach you slowly, walking with your head down.
- A low whine or growl, without any other warning signs, means the cat is scared. Don't get too close, but don't be afraid it will attack.

![Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-30]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deal-with-a-wandering-cat/v4-728px-Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-30.jpg.webp)

### 2.6 Try to identify the cat's owner. 

Start looking for the cat as soon as possible. If the cat is not wearing the tag, you can try the following:
- Talk to the neighbors.
- Take it to your veterinarian to scan if your cat has a chip.
- Call animal aid to ask if anyone reported the loss of a cat matching the cat trait you have.
- Hand out the leaflet with the large size FINDINGS on the photo of the cat's face.
- Check the local newspaper for missing objects. You can publish the newspaper for free in the "find" section.
- Do not reveal identifying details other than the color of the cat's fur or the photo of the cat's face.

![Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-34]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deal-with-a-wandering-cat/v4-728px-Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-34.jpg.webp)

### 2.7 Respond to the person who might be the cat's owner. 

If someone calls back, ask them about the cat's gender and other identifiers to make sure he or she owns the cat. If the cat does not have any special identification, ask them about their health records and vaccinations, including the cat's description, or ask about the veterinarian's contact details. Although less likely to happen, it is possible that someone pretends to be the owner of a cat to take it to sell or raise at no charge.
- If your cat has not been vaccinated or neutered/spayed (and leaves the house when the vaccination age is reached), consider letting the animal aid society know. There they can pick up the cat and ask the owner to complete these medical procedures before returning the cat.

![Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-23]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deal-with-a-wandering-cat/v4-728px-Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-23.jpg.webp)

### 2.8 Feed and care for your cat at regular times. 

Always bring the cat food yourself, and if the cat does, stay in the room while the cat eats. Food is the best tool to gain its trust. If your cat refuses to eat in your presence, you can leave it alone, but show it that you are the one providing the food.
- A familiar routine will help your cat predict when you will arrive, reduce your fear, and wait for your cat to eat.
- Sit in a cat's chair for a few minutes, at least a few times a day. Try to show the cat you are not a threat: Move slowly, shrink "small" by stooping, not looking directly into the cat's eyes, close your eyes, and pretend to be asleep, to be honest Quietly or without saying anything.

![Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-25]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deal-with-a-wandering-cat/v4-728px-Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-25.jpg.webp)

### 2.9 Try to touch the cat. It can take two to three weeks with several short daily interactions before your cat can calm down and comfortably eat with you. 

Now try slowly reaching out to place more of the treat near the cat, as close to the cat as possible before it cowering, growling, or intimidating. Do not throw food in or hold out fingers. Repeat this movement, bringing your hand closer to the cat if it will. Finally, you can bring your hand close enough that the cat can smell your hand. Let him smell his hand, then pull it back. If the cat approaches, try slowly petting its shoulders or any other parts the cat rubs against you. Petting slowly, gently, as the cat may be sensitive.
- Pay attention to your cat's body language. Most stray pets will let you touch them when they are calm and will provide warning signs if uncomfortable. (You can skip the hissing if the cat doesn't keep hissing more or turns into a growl.)
- There is a high risk of injury if the cat is truly feral. If your cat is not wearing a collar, peeking, or approaching you, check for signs that it is a feral cat.

![Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-37]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deal-with-a-wandering-cat/v4-728px-Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-37.jpg.webp)

### 2.10 Adopt a cat. 

If you've made a good effort to find a cat owner (by law in some regions) and no one has responded within a month, you can either adopt the cat or give it to the animal aid society. If you decide to adopt the cat as a family member, follow these steps:
- Take your cat to the veterinarian for a checkup, get tested for cat virus leukemia (FELV), cat's immunodeficiency disease (FIV), feline distemper, rabies, and helminths, vaccination, and treatment to cats. Do not let your cat come into contact with other pets in the house until all these procedures have been completed, including co-contact with the clothes you wear. 
- Cast or sterilize the cat to improve its health and behavior. Find a vet clinic that can cheaply sterilize cats.
- Gradually introduce your cat to other rooms and other pets in the house, getting acquainted with one room or one member at a time.

## 3. Deal with a stray cat

![Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deal-with-a-wandering-cat/v4-728px-Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-8-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Definitely be a feral cat. 

A feral cat has never been kept as a pet, never purred with people, or made eye contact with people. A stray cat's coat is generally cleaner and tidier than stray cats, as stray cats can take care of themselves. In addition, you can look for the following signs:
- Solitary stray cats are not usually castrated (male cats). Wild males are generally more muscular, muscular and have full cheeks than a castrated domestic cat. Some male cats have stiffer and shiny fur or have a hairless area at the base of the tail ("horse's tail"). 
- A pinched tip of the ear is an international sign of a desexed or spayed stray cat.
- Females usually live in the area around the landfill or other food sources. It can be difficult to tell a stray female from a stray cat when you find it alone. A pregnant or nursing female cat (with large breasts and nipples) is usually a feral cat. 

![Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-36]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deal-with-a-wandering-cat/v4-728px-Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-36.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Sterilize for cats. 

If your cat doesn't have a pinched tip, take it to your vet for castration or sterilization. It is advisable to sterilize cats before release to reduce annoying behaviors (such as spreading urine everywhere or screaming) and not increase feral cats. If the animal aid society or the vet has a Trap - Cast - Release program, they will probably do surgery for free. Take your cat to the vet right away so that he won't be locked in the trap for more than 12 hours.
- If you decide to participate in the Trap - Cast - Drop program, you should purchase a transfer cage. These are traps and cages that have an opening and are interlocked so that the cat can go into a larger space without escaping.
- You can also tell if your cat has been spayed directly: follow the instructions for observing male and female cats. However, this tutorial usually requires the touch of a cat and is not recommended until you have learned and experienced it.

3.3 Take care of your cat overnight. 

Usually, cats need 24 hours to recover from surgery, but some females take 48 hours. Cover the trap or cage with a towel and bring it to a comfortable temperature room, as a cat that has not run out of anesthetic cannot regulate its temperature. Keep the room as quiet as possible and do not allow other people or pets to enter the room. Follow your cat closely: 
- Feed the kittens as soon as they wake up, and feed the older cats eight hours after they wake up. Open the trap door slightly and put some food and water in the plastic lid into the trap without going inside. Do not do this if you are not sure it is safe to do so. The cat doesn't need to eat right away and is fine.
- Call the veterinarian's emergency number or your usual number if the cat is bleeding, has difficulty breathing, is vomiting, or doesn't wake up. If your cat is vomiting while drowsy, gently tilt the trap slightly to allow the vomit to drain out of her throat. 

![Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deal-with-a-wandering-cat/v4-728px-Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-9-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Release the cat. 

Adult feral cats are almost never trained to be domestic cats. Return the trap to where you caught it, open it, and wait for the cat to come out on its own.
- Disinfect and clean traps before using them to capture other animals.
- If you don't want that cat in the neighborhood, take it to the animal aid society. Cats rarely adapt well when released to a new place, but relief workers will know how to increase their chances of success.

3.5 Help the stray cat. 

If you want to help out, bring food and water near where you trapped it. Feral cats are susceptible to cold weather, so a shelter and water source (warm water bowl) in winter is very helpful in winter.

![Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-3]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-deal-with-a-wandering-cat/v4-728px-Handle-a-Stray-Cat-Step-3-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.6 Taming a wild cat. 

If the cat is friendly towards humans or is less than four months old, you can keep it as a partially domesticated pet. The first step is to take your cat to the vet for deworming and vaccination. Then, gradually familiarizing your cat with rooms in the house, one room at a time, may help you successfully communicate with the animal. Remember that this will be difficult for an adult stray cat, and you may need to release it if it doesn't work.

> Advice
- Stray cats are often dehydrated. You should give your cat some cat food or canned tuna with water. This "soup" will help improve the cat's health and appearance.
- If you see a sick or injured wandering cat while driving, pull over to the side of the road and signal other vehicles to slow down. If possible, stop your cat from reaching the roadway or lure him into your car with food. Call animal control instead of trying to get your cat away, as the cat may panic and prevent you from driving. 
- If you often see cats wandering on neighborhood streets, keep cat cages and pillowcases in your car. If you see an injured cat on the road and you can safely get it out of traffic, carefully wrap the cat in a pillowcase, place it in a cage, and take it to the vet or humanitarian organization. Contact those facilities in advance to inquire about their costs: some 24-hour emergency clinics or sponsored humanitarian organizations can treat wandering pets free of charge. Many other facilities have no funding and will charge a fee when you bring your cat.
- Watch for signs of cats wandering your neighborhood like torn trash bags, cat chirping at night, or the panic behavior of your pets (especially when they look out the door or window).
- You may have heard rumors that many people are illegally trying to accept stray cats for sale to the lab. This is true, but very rarely happens with cats, at least in America. In 2007, brokers in the US collected fewer than 300 cats from individuals, and not all were thieves or scammers. However, if you want to find a new home for a wandering cat, visit it yourself and retreat if you see any suspicious signs.

> Warning
- If you take the cat to the animal aid and no one comes to take it, they can finish it off (in other words make it sleep forever). If you don't want to, make sure to take your cat to a "no animals" place instead of an unclaimed place to kill pets. Convince those who are adopting a cat to adopt another cat so that it can have a new family instead of being killed.
- Stray or stray cats are more likely to get sick without being vaccinated and dewormed. Symptoms include watery eyes and nose, sneezing and coughing, difficulty breathing or making loud noises when breathing, sunken eyes, bones protruding and thin body, peeling or dry skin, hair loss, vomiting, diarrhea, not eating or drinking, difficulty moving, or only walking a few steps and then lying down again. Any of the above indications suggest that the animal needs medical attention as soon as possible.
- If you are bitten by a cat, quickly wash the wound with soap and water, and then contact your doctor. Wild or unvaccinated stray cats can spread rabies. Human rabies is 100% fatal but can be prevented with a timely vaccination against rabies. Your doctor can give you advice depending on how common rabies is in your area.
- Remember that cats can carry pathogens like FIV and FELV. These diseases can be transmitted to other cats and cause serious health problems. Before catching a cat, you need to take care of yourself first! This includes protecting yourself from stray cats and domestic cats, as well as getting adequate vaccinations for them.
