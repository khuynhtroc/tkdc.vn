## 1. Examination of hair and body

### 1.1 Check the coat's thickness. 

Depending on your cat's age, the coat can be thick or thin. Usually, cats won't go bald or lose their fur, but by considering the thickness of the coat, you will narrow their age.
- Older cats may have thinner fur.
- Weather can also affect the coat. Cat fur in summer will be thinner than in winter.
- If your cat has a lot of hair loss, seek medical attention.

### 1.2 Feel the smoothness of the cat's fur. 

The fur of a cat will vary slightly with age. By paying attention to those differences, you can get an estimate of how old your cat is.
- A kitten, either small or new, will have a smooth, rich coat.
- Older cats will usually have a more friable coat.
- Older cats may also have faded patches.

### 1.3 Pay attention to your cat's physique. 

The older the cat gets, the more activity levels change. Such changes can lead to a change in the form of the cat. Observing your cat's body shape can tell you its age.
- Young cats are usually slender and muscular due to regular activity.
- Middle-aged cats may be rounder and fatter.
- Older cats may have exposed shoulder blades and loose skin.

## 2. Observe the cat's behavior

### 2.1 Pay attention to your cat's mood. Older cats tend to have limited vision and hearing, and often experience pain from arthritis. These conditions can affect your cat's mood. If you notice that your cat has the following behaviors, it could be evidence that the cat is sick or old or both:

Your cat becomes overly aggressive when you come into contact with it.
- Older cats may also be more fearful and restless.

### 2.2 Observe how your cat uses the litter box. 

If your cat has trouble using the litter box, that could indicate a variety of problems. Specifically, older cats may have difficulty using the litter box due to health problems or a reduced ability to cope with stress. 
- Some health problems that can make it difficult for older cats to use the litter box include impaired vision, ulcerative colitis, kidney, or liver problems.
- Stress can also keep your old cat from using the litter box. Create an environment as quiet as possible for your cat.

### 2.3 Observe your cat's sleep cycle. In most cats, the older they are, the more they will sleep. You should keep an eye on when the cat goes to sleep, noticing changes as the cat gets older. 

Older cats can stay up all night and sleep all day. Older cats can also howl all night.
- As cats age, their activity levels decrease, and sleep time increases. Younger cats are usually active, playing all day, while older cats will only enjoy rest.

## 3. Observe the cat's eyes to determine the age

![Know-Your-Cat's-Age-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-determine-your-cat's-age/v4-728px-v4-728px-Know-Your-Cat's-Age-Step-7-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 See if the cat's eyes are blurred. 

As a cat gets older, the cat's eyes will often change from a clear, light to a dull, opaque state. By examining eye opacity, you can more accurately predict your cat's age.
- A pair of bright and clear eyes will indicate that the cat is quite young.
- Older cats may have blurred eyes due to age or cataracts.

### 3.2 Check the iris. 

The iris is the colored part that surrounds the pupil. By examining the iris, you will get an estimate of the cat's age. Watch for signs of uneven iris or tear.
- Younger cats have clean and even irises.
- As your cat ages, the iris will become smaller, and the macular spots will appear and abnormal pigmentation spots.

### 3.3 Watch for rust or tears. 

To check your cat's age and health, you can check the tear glands in your cat's eyes. With age, illness, or injury, a cat's eyes can become watery over time. Watery eyes, as well as injuries and other illnesses, are common in older cats, so you can determine the cat's age.
- Small cats usually do not shed tears or have a lot of rust.
- Older cats often have watery eyes and have a marked rusted eye.
- Watery eyes can also be a sign of illness or injury, so seek medical attention.

## 4. Check the cat's teeth

![Know-Your-Cat's-Age-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-determine-your-cat's-age/v4-728px-v4-728px-Know-Your-Cat's-Age-Step-10-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Count the cat's teeth. 

As cats age, their teeth will also undergo different growth stages. When the cat is comfortably relaxed, check the cat's teeth to determine its age.
- The first teeth to grow in a kitten are the incisors (for about 2-4 weeks) and canines (for about 3-4 weeks), then the molars (about 4-6 weeks).
- Cats younger than four months old may not yet have molars.
- Between 6 months and a year of age, your cat will likely have enough teeth. At this point, the cat's teeth are still white and show no signs of damage.

![Know-Your-Cat's-Age-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-determine-your-cat's-age/v4-728px-v4-728px-Know-Your-Cat's-Age-Step-11-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.2 Observe the yellow color on the cat's teeth. 

As your cat gets older, her teeth will also show signs of age. A set of yellow teeth shows that your cat is an old cat. The degree of damage and yellowing of the teeth will indicate what age your cat is.
- You may notice that the cat's teeth are a bit yellow when the cat is about two years old.
- When you are 3 to 5 years old, your cat's teeth will become even more yellow.
- Between the ages of 5 and 10, the yellow color will become more pronounced.
- By the time your cat is 10 years old or older, her teeth will be visibly yellow, and most of her teeth will be yellow.

![Know-Your-Cat's-Age-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-determine-your-cat's-age/v4-728px-v4-728px-Know-Your-Cat's-Age-Step-12-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.3 Check for signs of worn and broken teeth.

Another indication of age shown by the set of teeth is the degree of wear and tear. Carefully observe the cat's teeth for traces, so you can determine the cat's age.
- Teeth worn out are when they are no longer pointed, looking blunt than the teeth of younger cats.
- Some teeth may become worn or broken.
- Usually, cats will show signs of tooth erosion by the time they are 5 years old.
- If your cat is 5-10 years old, their teeth will be noticeably worn out.
- Over the age of 10, the teeth will be severely damaged. At this age, some teeth may fall out.
- The older the cat, the more likely it is that the cat will have more tartar and have gums. However, this is a vague sign because the cleanliness of the teeth depends on the cat's diet.

> Advice
- If you are unsure about your cat's age, the best way to determine it is to check with your veterinarian.
- Most of the signs of old age can also be signs of illness. Always schedule a visit if you suspect your pet is sick.
- If your cat is seriously ill and hurts a lot, don't force it to endure the pain just to keep it with you.
