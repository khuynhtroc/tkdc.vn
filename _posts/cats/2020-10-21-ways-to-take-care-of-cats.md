> With a mischievous nature, purring gestures, and a lovely face, cats are the ideal animals to raise as a pet. However, contrary to popular belief, cats are not pets that you can let them "take care of"! If you want your cat to live healthy and happy, you need to know how to care for your cat and give your four-legged friend the best life possible from the moment you get home.

## 1. Teach your cat to go to the bathroom

### 1.1 Encourage your cat to use a litter box.

Due to the texture of the litter, most cats will prefer the litter tray over other areas of the house. However, you still need to take a few steps to get your cat to like to poop in the litter box.
- Keep the litter box in a quiet place where the cat won't be disturbed by people or dogs passing by or making lots of noise.
- To keep the sand tray clean, make sure you shovel dirty sand daily and clean it weekly. You should also change the sand at least once a week. 
- If you have more than one cat, provide enough litter boxes for them. Assuming there are 2 cats in the house, you need 3 sand trays placed in many parts of the house. An authoritative cat can prevent the weaker one from using certain litter boxes

### 1.2 Make sure the cat is comfortable with the litter box. 

Don't frighten or startle your cat while defecating in the litter tray if you don't want it to have aversion to the tray and start avoiding it. Buy a large sand tray, although it is a bit more expensive. Your cat will feel more comfortable in a large tray (by area, not depth).
- Don't switch to a different brand of litter, as cats don't like sudden changes. Switching clay sand to lumpy sand or vice versa may upset your cat and stop using the litter box.
- You also shouldn't use sand that has a strong scent that scares the cat away.

### 1.3 Consider the needs of kittens and older cats. 

Remember that kittens and older cats with arthritis or other medical conditions can have difficulty getting in and out of a sand tray with too high walls. Buy a low-walled sand tray that is easily accessible for kittens and cats with special needs, or buy an adjustable tray.

### 1.4 Provide a scratching post for your cat.

Scratching is a natural instinct for cats, and there is no way you can train them to quit. If your cat still has claws, provide a scratching post or two so she won't scratch your furniture. If you have a scratching post, your cat will be spoiled for this healthy, natural behavior. 

![Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-5]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-take-care-of-cats/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-5-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 1.5 Do not allow your cat to freely explore "forbidden" areas indoors. 

Cats are intriguing, and your cat will jump on tables, shelves, or other places you don't want them to go. A cat chasing rug, a well-timed spray of water, even a stern "no" can correct this behavior. With time and patience, you can teach your cat to stay away from areas where they are not allowed to roam.
- You can also teach your cat with a shaking can (an empty soft drink can have a few pebbles inside and closes the top). Drop the can on the floor to scare the cat away from the restricted area. DO NOT throw the can at the cat, as this may harm the cat.

### 1.6 Consider using a cat pheromone product. 

This product comes in the form of an electric spray or diffuser that releases synthetic pheromones to help calm cats. It can help with cleaning tray or clawing problems and has been shown to help calm stressed or frightened cats.

## 2. Feed the cat

![Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-take-care-of-cats/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-7-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Decide what type of food you should eat. 

Cat food comes in a multitude of varieties: dry, wet, and canned foods are common. Dry food is easier to store, but cats love the taste of wet and canned foods. These two types also help to add more fluids to your cat's diet. In general, what kind of food is the owner's preference for the cat.
- Sometimes cats need to eat one type of food over another due to a medical condition. Consult with your veterinarian about this.

![Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-take-care-of-cats/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-8-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Choose a good brand when buying cat food. 

Like other animals, cats have their own nutritional needs. Cats are "obligatory predators," meaning that they need animal protein to avoid serious illness.  Ask your veterinarian to recommend good quality products. Inexpensive products may not provide enough nutrients to keep cats healthy and happy.
- Look for cat foods that are primarily animal protein, such as beef, chicken, turkey, or fish.
- You should also look for amino acids like taurine and arginine, fatty acids like arachidonic acid and linoleic acid.
- Avoid giving your cat human food unless you have discussed them with your veterinarian. Certain human foods can make cats seriously ill, and even poison the cat (such as chocolate).

### 2.3 Follow the instructions on the food packaging. Usually, cats need to be fed according to their age, weight, and activity level. They like to eat many small meals throughout the day. 

Consult with your veterinarian about what foods and how to feed your cat if you are in doubt.

![Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-take-care-of-cats/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-10-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 Don't overfeed your cat.

Follow your veterinarian's advice and make sure your cat gets active, as obesity is one of the major problems cats face today. Obese cats are at a higher risk of developing diabetes when they reach middle age. Being overweight can also lead to diseases like arthritis, heart disease, and other health problems in cats.

## 3. Keep your cat healthy

![Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-take-care-of-cats/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-11-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Groom your cat depending on his needs. 

You may think that cats don't need someone to groom them because they can groom themselves. However, you really need to brush short-haired cats weekly and long-haired cats a few times a week. This will help reduce hair loss indoors and prevent puffiness in the cat's stomach.
- For cats that often shed their hair (especially long-haired cats), you should use a small-toothed metal comb so that you can brush deep into the undercoat and remove any hair loss.

![Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-take-care-of-cats/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-12-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Check the cat's skin condition while brushing. 

Look for fleas and other parasites, red spots, swelling, lumps, or other skin problems. If you see any suspicious signs, let your veterinarian know and ask about what to do.

![Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-take-care-of-cats/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-13-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Schedule a cat's visit to the vet every year. 

Like all family members, cats need regular checkups. Cats, unlike children, cannot tell us when they are unwell. They only rely on you for care by getting regular checkups. Cats need to see the veterinarian at least once a year for teeth, ears, eyes, and heart checks, vaccinations, and deworming / flea treatment. Cat owners should consider vaccinating their cats for the following diseases: intestinal infection in cats, flu, and leukemia in cats. All of these diseases can be fatal if a cat becomes infected, so it's important to protect your cat. Many cat care stations will not accept cats without a certificate of vaccination. Your veterinarian will accurately recommend vaccinated diseases for your cat. If you really care about your cat's health and behavior,
- Older cats need to be seen twice a year for optimal health care.

![Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-take-care-of-cats/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-14-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Take the kitten to the vet more often. 

Like babies, kittens need to be seen by the doctor more often than older cats. Starting at around 8 weeks of age, the kittens need to be seen 2-3 times in the clinic for their vaccinations and worm treatment. As a minimum, cats need to be vaccinated against rabies and cocaine. Your doctor will also talk to you about the benefits of optional vaccines. Ask about the risks of diseases like leukemia in cats and decide which vaccines to vaccinate your cat.
- Your veterinarian will also check your kitten for fleas and ear lice and treat it if necessary.
- Remember to deworm the kittens. Kittens with roundworms are often stunted and can be transmitted to humans.

![Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-take-care-of-cats/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-15-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Sterilize for cats. 

There are many benefits to the sterilization of a female cat and castration of a male cat. You will reduce annoying cat behaviors such as quitting wandering around and spraying urine. On the health side, sterilization helps prevent the cat from unwanted pregnancy and diseases like metritis. And most importantly, this trick reduces the number of unwanted cats on earth!
- Ask your veterinarian about when to allow your cat to be spayed. Usually, doctors recommend sterilization when the kitten is 2-6 months old.

![Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-take-care-of-cats/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-16-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.6 Get the cat accustomed to brushing his teeth. 

Cats can suffer from oral disease. To brush your cat's teeth, you will need a soft toothbrush and a cat dog toothpaste. Never use human toothpaste to brush your cat's teeth - too much fluoride can upset your cat's stomach, and the high levels of fluoride in human toothpaste can be poisonous. First, give your cat a taste of the toothpaste, then use your finger to sweep the gum line in the upper teeth. Repeat the above steps, but this time using a toothbrush. Run the brush along the gum line of the upper molars at a slightly upright angle so that the bristles creep below the gum line. Brushback to the front with a circular motion along the gum line. It will take less than 30 seconds to brush your cat's teeth.
- At first, don't try to brush all of your cat's teeth. If the cat only allows you to brush the outside of the upper teeth, it is better than not. You still handle the most important part of your cat's preventive measures against dental diseases.

![Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-take-care-of-cats/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-17-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.7 Make an appointment for a specialist dental cleaning schedule if needed. Even with careful brushing, some cats still need specialist cleaning from time to time. Brushing can reduce plaque and deposits on the surface of the teeth, but not remove plaque just below the gum line. When cleaning your cat's teeth, the veterinarian will also do a thorough oral examination while the cat is sedated. Some signs of oral disease include:

Bad breath
- Loose teeth
- Teeth discolored or tartar clinging to the tooth surface
- Painful or tender sensation in the mouth
- Bleed
- Drool a lot and often drop food while eating
- Loss of appetite or weight loss

3.8 Make enough time for your cat to play. 

Your cat needs to be able to interact with you every day to be healthy and happy. Spend time playing with cat toys, talking, and grooming your cat to socialize with your cat. Laser pens, balls, toy mice, and feathers are also great fun to play with.
Here's a game you can play with your cat: Try hiding your cat's favorite food in a corner and directing the cat to it with a laser pointer. You will point the laser pen the way a real mouse moves, try pointing the laser pen at narrow spots and below hiding places. Finally, point to the right spot with the cat's favorite treat with a pen. The cat will be happy because it feels like hunting food.

## 4. Find a suitable cat


![Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-take-care-of-cats/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-19-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Decide if you should have a kitten or an adult cat.

Kittens are very attractive and lovable, but you need to honestly ask yourself if you can meet their energy level and take responsibility for them. In animal shelters, there are many mature cats that are friendly, but hard to find. An adult cat will be calmer and quieter than a kitten, but it may also have behavior problems from its early years. Adult cats may also have medical conditions that you will need to cure sooner than kittens. On the other hand, kittens often scratch very painfully; Think about it if you can.

![Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-take-care-of-cats/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-20-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.2 Consider your cat's health concerns. 

If you have a crush on a cat, ask about the medical history if the cat requires long-term care. Will you be able to meet that cat's need for healing?
- Even if the cat you like is perfectly healthy, consider a cat breed. Purebred cats may have genetic problems that must be fixed. For example, snare-faced breeds such as the Manx and Scottish often develop respiratory problems.
- Purebred cats are more likely to develop genetic diseases than hybrid cats. 

![Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-21]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-take-care-of-cats/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-21-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.3 Consider how much time you can spend with your cat. 

While it doesn't require daily walks like a dog, don't assume that cats aren't asking you to spend time with them. Cats are still active pets that need to be played and a loved one that needs attention. You will also have to take the time to clean the litter box and feed your cat properly.
- The average life expectancy of a domestic cat is 13-17 years, so keep in mind that you are making a long-term commitment to a new member of the family.

![Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-22]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-take-care-of-cats/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-22-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.4 Find out if you can afford a cat. 

The price of buying cats ranges from a few hundred thousand up to tens of millions if they are purebred cats. In addition, you will have to purchase cat food, litter, toys, and medical expenses. ASPCA (American Association for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) estimates the cost of raising a cat in the first year is $ 1,035 (more than 20 million dongs). (This amount will decrease after you purchase the items and pay the initial medical expenses.)

![Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-23]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-take-care-of-cats/v4-728px-Take-Care-of-a-Cat-Step-23-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.5 Consider adopting a cat at an animal shelter. 

The cost you will spend will not be much compared to what you get: a fully vaccinated cat, complete health check, and sterilization. If you accept a "free" cat, you will end up with all of the costs if you are a responsible owner.

> Advice
- Milk can cause upset cats in the stomach; New water is the best liquid for cats.
- Try giving your cat water instead of tap water if your cat is too fussy.
- Cats have claws and will use claws when they are excited, scared, angry, etc. So be careful, they will scratch you. Most of the time, cats scratching are just accidental. If your cat scratches you during playtime, just say: "NO" and stop playing. Your cat will eventually learn to control claws while playing.
- If you are bitten or scratched by a cat, wash the wound with soap and water, disinfect with alcohol (or other disinfectant solution), and cover it. See a doctor if the wound becomes swollen or signs of infection.
- Be careful with houseplants. Certain ornamental flowers can be extremely toxic to pets (such as poinsettias).
- Keep your cat indoors; Outdoor cats have a much shorter lifespan than cats that live indoors due to accidents, illness, dog attack, and other hazards.
- To reward your cat with a nice treat, buy catmint leaves and sprinkle some on a tile or wooden floor (don't spread it on the carpet, unless you plan to vacuum afterward!) Cats love cat mints! They often hang around and eat catmint leaves. Warning: cats can sometimes get very excited after being exposed to catmint leaves. This is not harmful, but very fun.
- Take the cat to the vet to have the chips implanted. This will make it easier to find and track the cat if it goes astray.
- Have your cat roam freely around the house if he likes you to petting. The cat will come to you on its own.
- Make sure to set aside a space for your cat, where it will not be disturbed, where the cat can go to when stressed, or simply want to rest.
- Let the cat move freely indoors, otherwise, your cat will feel trapped.
- If you find that your cat is not drinking or going to the toilet, take him to the vet as soon as possible.

> Warning
- Never leave a cat when you don't want to. Always bring animals you do not want to raise to the nearest animal shelter. There they will take care of your dogs and cats and try to find them a good home. Abandoning an animal is cruel.
- Be sure to give your cat water when it is playing with you for a long time.
- Never give your cat another animal product.
- Don't force the cat to do things that it doesn't want to, like:
- Pick up the cat whenever you want.
- Hug them too tightly
- Don't remove the cat's claw, as this is the equivalent of having a knuckle cut off. Cats will be in pain for life and be vulnerable (if attacked by predators).
- Alternatives to removing a cat's claw include: pruning the claw, using a scratching post and cat claw covers.
