> Perhaps this is the toughest decision every cat owner has to face: whether it's time to let his beloved four-legged friend go. This topic often hurts, but if you think about what's best for your pet, you need to make a rational decision. When deciding whether euthanasia is the right choice, you need to consider the cat's physical and mental condition and its overall quality of life.

## 1. Evaluate the cat's physical condition

### 1.1 Consider your cat's weight and ability to eat and drink. 

Food is essential to life. If you have pain (toothache, arthritis, and abdominal pain are most common in older pets) then your cat will have difficulty eating due to pain when standing or eating.
- Another case is that a cat eats but frequently vomits. Both of these situations are worrisome and lead to the cat losing weight. Weight loss by itself is not an indicator of euthanasia, but if the cat's body index falls below 1.5 / 5, the cat will be weak and lack of energy.
- If you don't expect your cat to gain weight again, consider giving the cat a painless death. If the cat's body count is even lower, by 1/5, it is time to let the cat go.

### 1.2 Determine your cat's body stats. 

Body score is a simple measure of how thin or fat a cat is. This assessment includes a scale of 1 to 5, with level 5 being obese and level 1 being skinny. The ideal number is 3.
- Level 1: Ribs, spine, and pelvis clearly protrude, even from a distance. The cat has no body fat and looks emaciated and starved.
- Level 2: Ribs, spine, and pelvis are easily palpable. Looking down from above, the cat has a distinct waist. The cat's belly is sucked in when viewed from the side. The cat looks skinny.
- Level 3: Ribs and spine are palpable but not visible. Cats have a slight waist when viewed from above and horizontally, but the belly does not drop when viewed from the side. Cats have an ideal body.
- Level 4: Difficult to locate the ribs and spine. The abdomen is pear-shaped when viewed from above and falls down when viewed from the side. Cats can be described as chubby or chubby.
- Level 5: Bone areas are covered with fat. There is a thick layer of fat on the chest and abdomen. The body has an oval shape. Cats are obese.

### 1.3 See if the cat is able to reach the bowl of water. 

Older cats need more water than young, healthy cats. This is because their kidney function often relies on water to remove toxins from the body. Your cat will need to be able to move around to get up and go to the bowl of water with minimal discomfort.
- Cats that are in pain will not get up unless necessary. They often delay drinking water for longer and become dehydrated easily, which in turn puts pressure on the kidneys and makes them feel more sick and unwell as toxins build up.
- You can of course move the water bowl within reach of the cat, but the rule here is that the cat should be able to move a short distance without pain. If this is not the case, the cat's quality of life is disturbing, and you may consider euthanasia for the cat.

### 1.4 Notice if your cat starts to dirty the coat. 

Cats are clean and proud creatures with sleek fur. They have a basic need for self-cleaning. If cats are unable to keep their coat clean, their dignity is compromised, and keeping cats alive is morally questionable.
- Of course, occasional incidents aren't a reason to act, but if your cat has persistent diarrhea, or has no control of her bladder to the point of causing her coat to smell, it will be miserable. If a cat that has been toilet-trained begins to dirty the house, that is also a reason for concern.
- However, before you decide to let your cat die painlessly, talk to your veterinarian about whether you can use pain relievers for your cat, or try replacing the litter box with a lower-walled one. Cats with arthritis will have difficulty stepping into sand trays with sloping walls, so they may choose to walk to the floor more easily.
- Likewise, stiff aching joints may prevent your cat from moving to another room. You can try giving your cat pain relievers to tackle this bad habit.

### 1.5 Consider your cat's ability to groom herself. 

Lack of grooming may be a sign that the back of the cat is stiff, or that the cat is sleeping more and is not properly groomed. Don't be alarmed, though, if your cat has this only habit, it is likely that your cat will be fine after a while.
- However, you can see things the other way too. A cat with well-groomed, sleek fur is one that remains proud of its appearance and strong enough to do so. If this describes your cat properly then it may not be time to die.
- Of course, if your cat has trouble grooming herself, you can make a big difference to it yourself. An old cat with ruffled fur that is brushed by its owner will help you feel more satisfied with yourself.

### 1.6 Determine if your cat can sleep without pain. 

This factor is very important. It is essential that your cat sleep and rest without being interrupted by pain. A cat that is sore is often restless and shows signs of swishing her tail back and forth or her ears pressed against the back of her head.
- The pain can strain the muscles, and the cat is more likely to curl upwards, in a curled manner instead of lying on his side with her legs comfortably stretched. Painful cats are also more likely to get angry and irritable. So watch out for a change in temper in your cat, such as a gentle cat that is suddenly wheezing and irritable.
- Of course, there are different degrees of pain, and each cat has different stamina. When deciding whether it's time to let the cat go, consider whether the time of grief the cat has been much longer than the time when the cat feels comfortable.

## 2. Consult with a veterinarian

### 2.1 Discuss with a veterinarian. 

Don't forget to have a vet to advise you. Ideally, your cat has been seen by the vet for many years, as the veterinarian has been monitoring the cat's life and its normal behavior.
- Your doctor already knows you too, and this will help make the discussion more honest and complete when discussing the best option for your cat.

![Know-when-to-Euthanize-Your-Cat-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-know-when-to-kill-a-cat/v4-700px-Know-when-to-Euthanize-Your-Cat-Step-8.jpg.webp)!

### 2.2 Call your vet at the first sign. 

If your cat is taking the medication regularly and he is familiar with it, you should call your doctor about the first sign of concern.
- Your veterinarian may suggest that you take your cat to the hospital, change the dose of medication, or change another medication. The doctor will also try to find a solution for your cat before asking for euthanasia.
- At the first sign of concern, talking with your doctor is not necessarily about euthanizing your cat, it's just about finding the best treatment for your cat.

### 2.3 Make an appointment with your vet to see your cat.

If your cat has not been seen in a while and you are concerned about the cat's health now, make an appointment with your doctor to get her examined.
- As above, this step does not mean you have to painlessly die, it just allows the veterinarian to do a comprehensive health check on the cat and you have time to discuss directly with the doctor.
- This will allow you to get an honest opinion about the cat's health, and if it is not time to let the cat go, you also have a criterion for assessing the cat's debilitating condition in the future.

### 2.4 Know what signs the doctor will look for to consider euthanasia. 

There are two factors that determine suicide. The first is physical, and the second is mental.
- The vet's role is to check for signs of illness or pain the animal is suffering or is about to endure and help you choose a treatment plan. Sadly, euthanasia is sometimes considered an appropriate "treatment" if it is not possible to alleviate the cat's pain with medicine or other means.
- During the exam, your doctor will evaluate factors such as the water level in the body, the cat's physical condition, and signs of pain. Your doctor will also tackle problems such as anemia or cancer, a sign that the cat is less likely to respond to treatment. Your cat will also be assessed for mobility and mental state.

### 2.5 Understand that your cat wants only what's best for your cat. 

Their job is to make sure the animal is free from pain, and if the cat has a problem that adversely affects its quality of life and has little chance of improvement, the doctor will help you understand this and the direction. leading you to make the right decision.

![Know-when-to-Euthanize-Your-Cat-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-know-when-to-kill-a-cat/v4-700px-Know-when-to-Euthanize-Your-Cat-Step-12.jpg.webp)!

### 2.6 Be honest with the vet about the cat's condition. 

In some cases, cats that seem tired at home feel better when they go to the clinic. This is simply due to stress.
- Know that this is possible, (and the doctor knows it), so be honest with your doctor and describe how your cat looks at home. Your doctor will help you make the right decision.
- Remember that some factors, such as age-related weakness, are best evaluated by the pet owner instead of relying on the 10-minute vet for advice.

## 3. Make a decision

### 3.1 Make a list when you are calm. 

Even if your cat is healthy, make a list of things that would be unacceptable to you if the cat started or stopped showing them. The checklist can include items such as a cat no longer grooming, not eating, or frequently soiling carpets and furniture. The above checklist will help you to recognize when your cat will start to show these symptoms.

![Know-when-to-Euthanize-Your-Cat-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-know-when-to-kill-a-cat/v4-700px-Know-when-to-Euthanize-Your-Cat-Step-13.jpg.webp)!

### 3.2 Find a tipping point. 

Life is a balance. Sometimes things go well one time, other times it doesn't work out, but in the end, everything needs to be balanced. The lives of cats are not much different from this fact.
- An old or sick cat will have good days and bad days, but if the overall balance is positive and the "bad" day never turns terribly painful then you have reason to stay alive. for cats. However, there will come a time when the bad overwhelms the good.
- A tipping point may occur when the cat no longer responds to pain relievers or you notice that the cat's hygiene is getting worse. Although every cat is different, when the quality of life becomes unacceptable, the tipping point is reached.
- Once the tipping point is reached, euthanasia may be the most humane thing for your cat.

### 3.3 Try to balance all the factors. 

The nature of difficult decisions is that they are not clear. In terms of balance, one big factor (like a cat with a stroke) may not be as important as many smaller ones put together (like a cat no longer grooming, begins to stain, and lose weight).

![Know-when-to-Euthanize-Your-Cat-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-know-when-to-kill-a-cat/v4-700px-Know-when-to-Euthanize-Your-Cat-Step-15.jpg.webp)!

### 3.4 Consider your cat's quality of life. 

"Quality of life" is a term that is often mentioned a lot in euthanasia in animals. As well as physical factors, such as pain, quality of life can be an abstract concept that includes factors such as cat's joy in life. Considering your cat's quality of life will help you make a humane decision.

![Know-when-to-Euthanize-Your-Cat-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-know-when-to-kill-a-cat/v4-700px-Know-when-to-Euthanize-Your-Cat-Step-16.jpg.webp)!

### 3.5 Prioritize quality over quantity in life. 

One useful concept to keep in mind is "quality of life, not the quantity of life". If you decide to keep your cat alive, it is important to make sure that the cat has a life worth living. If your cat is in constant pain then perhaps euthanasia is better for it, since the cat's quality of life is non-existent.

![Know-when-to-Euthanize-Your-Cat-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-know-when-to-kill-a-cat/v4-700px-Know-when-to-Euthanize-Your-Cat-Step-17.jpg.webp)!

### 3.6 Trust your intuition. 

Trusting your intuition is wise advice in deciding to let your cat go without pain. You know your cat well, and most likely, if you think your cat is suffering, it probably is. No owner wants to say goodbye to your pet, but you need to put the cat's interests above your emotions. You can feel when the time is right.

![Know-when-to-Euthanize-Your-Cat-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-know-when-to-kill-a-cat/v4-700px-Know-when-to-Euthanize-Your-Cat-Step-18.jpg.webp)!

### 3.7 Don't feel guilty because you made the right decision. 

The first thing you need to remember is when you decide to let your cat go smoothly, you are neither killing it nor doing it for God. There is absolutely no point in thinking like this. In fact, you have made a positive decision to keep your cat from experiencing unnecessary pain, discomfort, and suffering.
- Second, it is better to let the cat go than to do nothing and watch the cat fall. Owners of cats usually don't take euthanasia lightly, and if the thought of euthanasia comes to mind, your cat is likely to suffer or is about to suffer.
- Finally, remember that the cat has given you love and affection for the rest of its life, and when their quality of life is gone, it is not selfish to decide to say goodbye and help bring it to an end. life properly.

> Advice
- The occasional return of cats to normal is not a reason to delay euthanasia for cats that lose weight, make dirt, and no longer want to befriend humans.
