## 1. Take good care of your cat

### 1.1 Give the cat adequate food and drink. 

The right diet is very important in your cat's health. Obesity is a common problem in pets. You should choose quality cat food at the pet store and suitable for their age. 
- Follow the directions on the packaging to measure the right amount of food. However, this is only a guideline because there are cases where the over-quantity is prescribed by the manufacturer, so you should consider the amount of food if the cat is losing or gaining weight.
- If you don't know what brand to choose from, talk to your veterinarian. They will be more than happy to help.
- Watch out for junk food. Cats are always looking for good food and will beg you for some favorite fish. You should only feed your cat treats occasionally to avoid obesity.
- Do not leave fish meat unattended. Bear in mind that your cat can jump high and will not obey the rules. If you are not in the room, the cat may clumsily eat the delicious sausage on the table.

### 1.2 Make sure your cat is healthy. 

Cats can have many diseases both outdoors and indoors. It's important to take your cat to the vet at least twice a year. Cats need to be sterilized to avoid birth and reduce the risk of HIV in cats.
- Many countries require cat sterilization to control their population.
- Always deworm and kill lice often, especially if your cat lives outdoors a lot. Cats will feel uncomfortable if they are itchy all the time!
- Ask the veterinarian to implant the cat with microchips. This method can help in the event that a stray animal is found and is sometimes required.
- Look for the following symptoms: weight loss, lack of energy, aggressive behavior, eye inflammation, wound, moodiness, dirty ears.

### 1.3 Keep the environment clean. 

Cats always want to stay clean, because, in order to hunt and survive, their bodies must not smell. As a result, cats are very sensitive to odors and need a clean space to feel satisfied.
- Do not bathe your cat. Cats have the ability to clean and spend a lot of time grooming. Bathe your cat only if it is heavily soiled or has come into contact with toxic products that cannot be swallowed.
- Clean the toilet tray clean. Cats bury their feces to avoid detection. Their instinct is to find clean soil, and if you don't meet the standards, they'll look elsewhere. Change the soil at least twice a week and shovel fertilizer daily.

### 1.4 Cuddle your cat. Cats love to interact with their owners. 

You can pet your pet at least twice a day and talk to it. Most cats like to be petted behind the ears, on the sides of the nose, and under the chin.
- Always pet the cat from forehead to tail. Put your hands on your head and follow your spine. Do not claw in the opposite direction of the hair growth that will make the cat uncomfortable.
- Do not touch the pet's tail and paws. Cats hate this!
- Your cat may allow you to pet your stomach if it trusts you. Do not try to touch these sensitive areas as this can stress the cat.
- Cats don't like being touched for too long. If the animal shows signs of being irritated or stressed, you should stop immediately.
- Sometimes cats are unpredictable animals. Always keep close supervision when letting children petting cats. Show your child how to touch pets gently and without moving quickly. Your cat will scratch if it feels threatened.

## 2. Stimulate your cat indoors

### 2.1 Get the cat free. 

Cats need to have some space to enjoy themselves. Do not bother your pet too much and let them do what they want privately. Set up a quiet room in your cat's home that won't be disturbed by children.
- Your cat's own space doesn't need to be large. Cats love self-contained places, such as paper boxes, and will use this space for comfortable sleep. [4]
- Plant a tree or cat grass near your pet's own area. This particular plant is beneficial for their digestive system and does not induce vomiting like garden grass.
- You can purchase a cat bed at the pet store. Look for something that is easy to clean, as the basket will get dirty or smell bad after some time.
- Have the cat look out the window. They love to watch birds and humans.

### 2.2 Provide games of entertainment. 

Cats are independent animals and can handle themselves when you're away from home. However, you need to prepare lots of toys to entertain them. You can buy cat toys at most pet stores and supermarkets. When you get home, don't forget to play with them too! Your cat needs physical exercise.
- You can make your own cat toys. Tie the string to the doorknob and let the cat play tug of war.
- Alternatively, you can let your cat play ball. They will chase like they would when chasing mice.
- Have a clawing post or your cat will scratch her claws on the mattress in the house.
- Use a laser pen or flashlight on the floor. The cat will try to catch the light and get very excited.

### 2.3 Get more cats. 

Your cat may be alone, but will also be glad to have you. You can get more cats if you have to work a lot and have space and energy. Remember to have your new pet sterilized so you cannot breed! To get your cat to get acquainted, you can take the following steps:
- Older cats often show hostility at first. At first, separate the new cat and familiarize it with the room. The old cat cannot see but can still smell another animal's appearance.
- Get your cat to get used to while eating and drinking, but place the trays on opposite corners of the room. Separate the two cats after eating and start again the next day.
- After a few days, you can have two kids meet, but keep an eye on the situation at all times. If there is a fight, separate them quickly and repeat the steps the next day.

## 3. Explore the outside world

### 3.1 Prepare the garden. 

There are a few things you need to think about before you let the cat go out. Make sure you have a place to sleep for your pet outside. Cats love to sleep in the garden. Look for shade and rain protection. Install a pet door on the back door so that the cat can access it. Keep food in protected areas.
- Note food to the outside. Do not let other animals finish.
- Get your cat checked before leaving. Talk to your veterinarian about the risks and a few things to keep in mind.

### 3.2 Get the cat out. 

There is a lot of debate now about whether cats are truly satisfied indoors. If there are trees around the house, let them out. Cats are predators and love to be outdoors. This is an effective way to keep your pet healthy.
- Be careful when your home is near busy roads. Cats are not responsive to vehicles. 
- Follow pets for the first few days and don't let them go too far. It takes time for the cat to adjust to its new environment.
- Pay attention to other cats. They can view your garden as their territory and will see your pets as a threat.
- Don't rely too much on using a fence to keep cats in the garden. They will find a way out.
- You can wear a collar on your cat, but some will get stuck in the fence with a collar and can lead to suffocation. Microchip implantation is a safer option, and all lifeguards and veterinarians now scan the animal's body before disposing of it.

### 3.3 Hunting cats. 

Do not restrain your cat's habit of hunting birds and mice. Your pet is a lion, a predator, and has an instinct to kill small animals. Make sure there are no dangerous animals outside, or the cat will become a target for other predators!
- Cats love to hunt rats and birds. Also, you can see them chasing flies and other insects.
- Never punish cats if they hunt and kill other animals. They won't understand why they get punished!
- Note that domestic cats hunt for entertainment, not because they are hungry or outside. When you see a cat bringing rats or dead birds into the house, it may not be them but another cat that can hunt.
- Don't leave your cat outdoors if your home is in an area close to endangered small animals.
