### 1.6 Play with your cat. 

Your cat may be upset because you are not spending enough time with it. If your cat has an active personality, you should play around with it - however, most cats love to play catch-up. Here are some cat games:
- Throw a piece of cellophane or curled paper at the cat. You can also substitute a toy mouse, but don't throw the toy at the cat; you should aim for the spot just in front of its claw.
- Wave a piece of string in front of the cat. While shaking, slowly move the rope back and forth, approaching and backing away in front of the cat. You can even sweep the string across the cat's claws.
- Use a laser pointer to project a spot on a wall or floor. When the cat notices this red spot, move the tip of the pen. Your cat will probably chase the red dot from the tip of the stylus.
- Use "cut bait". The toy is a long, flexible stick with a feather or string attached to the end of the stick. Some toys even have bells attached. Grab one end of the stick and wave the end of the ornament near the cat's claw. Gently swing the tip of the stick - your cat may try to jump up to grab the toy.

This may also mean spending some time playing with the cat.

### 1.9 Give your cat what it wants appropriately. 

Cats can be irritable if they don't get what they want. These things are sometimes quite simple and harmless - like sitting on a soft, soft pillow. There are other times when what they want is not good, like a portion of your food. Certain human foods can be very harmful to your cat's health. If your cat asks for something harmless, you can accommodate it. If what your cat wants could be dangerous, give it something else instead.
- If your cat wants to sit on the soft pillow on the sofa, let it sit. You can even pick up the cat and put it in that position. Cuddle the cat a bit to calm it down.
- If your cat asks to drink milk or eat tuna, offer something else. Milk or cream can make a cat uncomfortable in the stomach, while tuna can be dangerous when a cat eats large amounts because it contains high levels of mercury. [4] Look for a cat-specific treat.

## 2. Comfort your cat

### 2.1 Reward the cat with its favorite treat.

If your cat is in a better mood, you can reward her directly. Place a few or three of the cat's food in the palm of your hand and sit down next to the cat. If the cat is willing to forgive you, it will come over and eat the food in your hand. You can now pet the cat behind the ear (or any other place the cat likes). If the cat doesn't approach you, place the treat on the floor, and step away. Don't take the reward away - this will only disappoint the cat.
- Cat treats come in a variety of textures: soft and chewy, hard and crunchy, in addition to being crispy in soft, dry meats (like beef jerky) and dried dishes. You can find dried tuna pellets on cat food stalls at the pet store.
- Cat favorites also come in a variety of flavors, including chicken, turkey, tuna, and salmon. You can also find flavored cat grass.

### 2.2 Leaving a delicacy that surprised cats. 

Remember to put it in a place where the cat can find it. Here are a few suggestions:
- If the cat is hiding under the bed, try leaving the treat under it. Don't put it too far under the bed, as the cat will have to get out of the "safe" position if it wants to grab food, and this will scare him. Also, don't put your hand too deep under the bed or you won't get scratched by the cat.
- If your cat seems agitated, place a treat near the food or favorite place. If you make your cat angry by taking its place, you can place a treat for your cat right there. This will let the cat know that you are at fault and that she can sit in her favorite spot without getting chased.

### 2.3 Add treats to your cat's normal food.

### 2.6 Play with your cat with toys. 

If your cat likes toys, you can buy new toys for them. You just need to approach the cat, kneel down, and show the cat the toy. You can put a toy on the ground and back out or you can throw it in. This depends on how much the cat likes to play with the item. Remember that not all cats like to play, especially older cats.
