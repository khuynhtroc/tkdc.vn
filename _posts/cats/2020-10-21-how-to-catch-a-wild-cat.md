## 1. Prepare

### 1.1 Observe the cat for a while. 

Before you catch or even approach a feral cat, be sure to watch it for signs of illness and injury. To ensure the safety of you and the cat, you need to assess the animal's health and make a possible plan for when and how to support it. If your cat has been in a particular area for a few days, take some time to observe it closely. If the cat is quite friendly, this will be easier. On the contrary, you will have to put in a lot of effort.
- If your cat behaves abnormally, is panting, drooling a lot, or looks dull and unusual, you should call Animal Control. Don't try to approach cats that show signs of illness. Cats can be infectious to humans and vice versa. A dangerous and incurable disease is rabies transmitted by saliva through a bite or wound on the skin. Another risk is a serious infection caused by a cat bite. An animal control specialist has the equipment and protection necessary to safely catch sick stray cats.
- You don't have to catch all feral cats. Cats should not be fed enough and are wearing a collar. Instead, call your neighbor and ask if they have lost their pet.

### 1.2 Prepare a live trap. 

This is an absolutely safe and simple way to easily and humane catch a cat. Prepare the bait with food, and then the cage door will close when they step inside and safely confine the animal. After you have caught the stray cats, keep them in the cage and take them to the vet. Do not release the cat from the cage.
- Your veterinarian and ranch will lend you live traps to catch feral cats. You don't need to buy it, although this is a practical tool if you live in the suburbs and often encounter wildlife that needs handling.
- If you can't find or use a trap, you can use a cage or box to bait food and catch the cat. Talk to your veterinarian before taking the cages out for a cat as some veterinarians do not accept cats in the cage except live traps. Live traps are generally safer and more effective, many of which can still help in an emergency.

### 1.3 Don't use unsafe practices to catch a cat. 

Don't try to catch stray cats by picking them up or using pillowcases or any kind of bag. These methods can anger and agitate feral cats, injure them, and put themselves in danger. Under no circumstances should stray cats be caught by bare hands, but rather slowly.

### 1.4 Prepare a place to keep the cat. 

You don't have to choose the right place to keep the cat, even if you are only planning to take them to the vet and then release them. It's best to keep your cat close to the date of the spay, so you can take it to the vet immediately. However, if you need to keep the cat for a while, make sure you have a quiet room in the house where the cat will live.
- Wild cats should stay in a quiet room to reassure themselves and feel safe. You can keep your cat in the basement, guest bedrooms, and other temperature-controlled and dark areas to help calm and feel more secure.
- If you plan to get your cat to the vet within 12 hours, don't worry about feeding your cat. Also opening the door or moving the cage can threaten the animal again. Prepare clean water and leave them in the cage trap.

### 1.5 Take the cat for sterilization and physical examination.

After you have caught the animals, the first thing to do is to have them sterilized.

## 2. Cat traps

### 2.1 Start feeding your cat a few days before you want to catch it. 

Make sure the cat wants to stay here and eat the food from the trap.
- After making an appointment to see your cat, hide the food for a day or two before setting the traps, and get them examined.
- Use dry cat food, or store-bought canned foods, to feed your cat. In times of need, if you don't buy cat food, you can use canned tuna or fish to attract cats.
- Do not give your cat milk. Contrary to popular belief, cats cannot digest dairy products, and you may have trouble giving them milk. Only give your cat dry food.

### 2.2 Set up traps and lure. 

Use the foods you feed your cat. Put a paper or pillowcase on the wire floor of the cage and place the food on the inside of the cage so the cat has to reach inside to get food, put some food at the door of the cage to lure the animal, then scatter the food inside. cage.
- Each trap works in a different way but still has something in common. Usually, you just need to open the cage door and secure it with the wire lock bar. When the door is closed, the animal will be locked inside.
- Cover the trap with a towel or cloth and leave the entrance to make it more obscure and less visible. People who have difficulty catching cats like to look behind the cage. If you're having trouble catching the cat, open the cover and reveal the back of the cage.
- Do not use a food bowl. A cat can roam around after being caught and may harm itself with anything in the cage.

### 2.3 Check traps regularly. 

Live traps are very safe, but you don't want to leave your cat outside in a cage unattended for a long time. This means checking regularly and seeing if you've caught the cat. If your cat is already in a cage, you can take it to the prepared room, or immediately take it to the vet if needed.

### 2.4 Put the cat in the cage. 

After catching the cat, cover the cage with a cloth and move into the pre-prepared area. Your cat will feel calmer if it moves in the dark, so lower the light and cover the cage completely.
- Leave the cat in the cage trap. Do not let the cat go out or switch to another cage, or you will have to catch them again. Once caught and moved, cats often want to stay in a small space, so prepare your cage for the perfect spot to feel safe.

## 3. Find a new home for the stray cat

### 3.1 Have your cat sterilized and treated if necessary. 

Have your cats sterilized and at least have rabies vaccinations, kill parasites (fleas or helminths), vaccines against viruses, and test for leukemia in cats. In many places services are provided free of charge under the general animal control policy.

### 3.2 Release the cat. 

The female cat should be monitored in a cage with a litter box, food, and water available about 5 days after spaying. Male cats can be released after surgery. You can drop them back to where they were before, or take them elsewhere.
- If you are putting your cat in a new environment, you will need to help it get used to it for a few weeks. To do this, leave your cat's food, water, and shelter regularly. Cats released into new territories cannot survive without caregivers because they do not have access to food, water, or shelter. In addition, other cats can also attack new cats to dispute territory.

### 3.3 Contact a rescue organization or humanitarian animal camp. 

If you live in a city, it is irresponsible to release a stray cat. Instead, you should take them to a rescue organization or humanitarian camp. The staff will work hard to find a new owner for the cat.
- Feral cats in a zoological farm are often never adopted as they are more than 90% likely to die without pain. If the cat has not been adopted, let it go back to where you caught it.
- Many rescue organizations will cover the medical costs of stray cats, so you can save some money.
- If possible, take care of the cat until you find a new owner. The number of cats in an organization is more than the number of people wanting to adopt a pet. You don't have to feel uncomfortable if they want to find someone who can take care of your cat with experience.

### 3.4 Find a new home for the cat if necessary. 

If you are sure that the cat does not belong to another person and you are uncomfortable or unable to care for the cat, find a new owner for it. You can post ads, ask people around you, and find new homes for cats.
- Ask a friend or relative who has a need to keep a cat. Start with close friends and acquaintances. You can then find new owners and visit them occasionally.
- Post advertisements on the Internet or local newspapers. Describe in detail the cat's situation.

### 3.5 Consider having a cat. 

Some stray cats can be pets once they get used to human life. Consider carefully the time, money, and environment in which the pet will be cared for. If you intend to keep cats, make sure they have adequate medical care and safe animals before you let them in.

> Advice
- Some humanitarian and rescue organizations will lend you the live trap for free.
- Cats are quite picky about humans. If your cat is not interested in you, ask a friend for help.
- Taming a stray cat is not easy. If they are natural, you should capture them, take them to a veterinarian, and then release them into their natural habitat.
- Wear thick clothing when trying to catch stray cats as they can scratch your skin.
- Do not take your cat to pet stores or inhumane ranches. Get to know the organization before you bring your cat.
- Distinguish stray or stray cats. You need the help of the rescue team to do this. One feature to keep in mind is that feral cats rarely call.
- If there are no animal farms in your locality, you can go to the internet to search for animal farms in other regions. They can help.

> Warning
- You can lift the kitten by grabbing the nape of the neck, but applying it in an adult cat will hurt. They can also twist and scratch you in this position.
- Be careful of keeping the kittens separate from the mother cat. Kittens should only be away from their mothers when they are 4-6 weeks old. However, if you catch the nursing mother, the kittens could die if left unattended.
- Animal bites are very dangerous! If you are bitten, seek medical help and isolate the cat in case of rabies or some other infectious disease.
- Wild cats can carry diseases such as leukemia and diseases caused by viruses. Wash your hands and wash clothes well before handling your pet. Keep the stray cat away from pets and its belongings, including the litter box and litter box, until you see the vet.
- Do not feed and keep cats unless they have the owner's permission. They may have diabetes or get used to being fed by others and leaving their owners.
