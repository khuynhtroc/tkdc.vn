> Advice
- A cat's hearing and smell are more sensitive than humans; Therefore, in short, cats are better and faster able to compensate for lost sight than humans.
- Cats can also be less stressed than humans when they lose sight. They do not realize what is not "normal". Yesterday, cats can see normal, today they cannot. You don't have to overly humanize what the cat is going through, instead, you should work hard to enhance its life experience differently.
- A well-shielded outdoor shack is safer for a blind cat than an empty garden or yard.
- If there are children in the home, explain to them why toys and other utensils should be kept in the right places.
- Encourage your cat to climb more than run. When climbing, they will be less likely to crash into furniture. You can use a vertical climbing post or something similar to encourage your cat. Cyan fiber is the ideal material to seal the surface of the climbing post.

> Warning
- Cats with symptoms of impaired vision should see a veterinarian immediately.
- Cats with a medical condition such as diabetes need to be checked often for signs of nearing blindness.
- Many cases of blindness are completely incurable.
