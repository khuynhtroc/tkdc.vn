title: "How to deal with a cat scratching?"
summary: When you notice that your cat's behavior has changed recently, she is probably under stress. Our concept of stress is different from that of cats, and sometimes even a little thing disturbs their well-being. Changes in everyday life, feral cats appearing in the garden, new litter, an owner traveling long distances, or visiting a vet can all be unhappy. Not only is stress uncomfortable for your cat (and you), but has potential health effects such as impaired immunity, increased risk of infection, and excessive hair licking. Therefore, it is very important to adopt ways to reduce stress in cats.

> Cats are mischievous, unpredictable, and sometimes aggressive creatures. If you interact with cats a lot, you may get scratched by the cat from time to time. Cats have sharp claws for defense, and they can sometimes cause fairly deep scratches. Properly taking care of your cat scratches will help avoid complications from the wound.

## 1. Evaluate the cat scratching wound

### 1.1 Identify your cat. 

It is important to have information about the cat that has scratched you. If it is a domestic cat or a cat from a close friend, it can be considered a domestic cat. You can treat the wound yourself if it's not too heavy, and know the exact facts about the cat:
- Cats have been fully vaccinated.
- Cats are in good health.
- Cats are mostly indoors.

### 1.2 Seek medical attention if you are unaware of the cat that has scratched you. 

Strange cats may not be vaccinated, so you may need preventive treatment for bacterial infections, tetanus, or rabies. Especially when the scratch is accompanied by a bite (up to 80% risk of infection), you need to see your doctor for medical attention.

### 1.3 Evaluate the wound. 

The appropriate treatment is based on the severity of the wound. Any scratch can be painful, but the depth of the wound will indicate if it's serious.
- A shallow wound that occurs on the outermost layer of the skin and slightly bleeding can be considered a skin wound.
- A deeper wound penetrates multiple layers of skin and heavy bleeding can be considered serious.

### 1.4 Decide on the appropriate treatment. 

A cat scratched skin wound can be treated at home. However, a cat scratching wound or a serious (deep) wound by a domestic cat should be evaluated by a medical professional.

### 2.1 Handwashing. 

Before handling any cat scratched skin, make sure your hands are clean and sterile. Use soap and warm (or medium hot) water to wash your hands for at least 20 seconds. Be careful to wash both your fingers and under your fingernails. Then rinse the water thoroughly.

### 2.3 Wash the skin that has been scratched by the cat. 

Use soap to thoroughly wash the affected skin. Try to wash both the wound and the surrounding skin (for example, if the cat scratches the arm, wash your arm instead of just washing the scratch). After washing with soap, rinse thoroughly with clean water.
- Do not rub the scratched skin, as this can cause additional damage (bruising) to the tissues.

### 2.4 Apply ointment to scratch. 

Treat cat scratches with an antiseptic ointment. A synthetic antibiotic ointment such as Neosporin can be used; These ointments contain neomycin, an antibiotic that is very effective in healing cuts.

### 2.5 Do not cover the wound tightly. 

Only home treatment is recommended for cat scratched skin wounds, so they don't need a bandage. Keep the wound clean during the healing period, but it is advisable to let the wound be exposed to fresh air.

### 3.2 Stop bleeding.

- Cat scratch disease in humans can cause serious eye, brain, liver, or spleen damage.
- People who lack resistance are at high risk of complications or even death from cat scratch fever.
- The diagnostic method for cat scratch disease is usually a B henselae serological test, but it can also be diagnosed with bacterial culture, histopathology, or polymerization chain reaction. The disease is treated with antibiotics such as azithromycin, rifampin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, or Bactrim.
