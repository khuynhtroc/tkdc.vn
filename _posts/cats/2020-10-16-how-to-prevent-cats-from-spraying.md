### 1.1 Sterilize for cats. 

Un-spayed male cats are the most likely culprit of this very unpleasant behavior. Occasionally, unspayed female cats spray their urine. Therefore, sterilizing your cat before 6 months of age is a good idea to prevent your cat from forming a habit when it reaches puberty. However, a small percentage of male cats and an even smaller proportion of sterilized female cats still spray urine.

### 1.2 Take great care of your cat. 

There are cats who spray their urine to get attention. Make time each day to cuddle and interact with your cat. Despite its reputation for being aloof and independent, your cat still wants to interact with you. Grooming your cat or playing light catches (using laser lights) are great ways to interact with your cat.
- Toys such as feathers, fake mice, balls and treats to let your cat explore will help your cat get active and excited. Furniture for cats will allow them to climb, hide, and rest, away from indoor noise. Pet shops and vet clinics have a wide variety of cat toys and furniture, and the staff there can help you make smart choices.

### 1.3 Help your cat avoid stress. 

There are homeopathic remedies that help soothe and reduce anxiety in cats. Some cats respond to herbs that have sedative effects such as fenugreek, valerian, kava, chamomile, and St. Joseph's. John's wort. Before using these therapies, you should ask a veterinarian who is knowledgeable about homeopathic treatments to make sure it doesn't harm your cat.
- One last option is an anti-anxiety medication used in cats that do not respond well to non-pharmacological therapy. Medicines such as amitriptyline, buspirone, diazepam imipramine, progestins, and clomipramine are all used to control the spraying behavior of cats. The side effects of medications vary, and some are more effective for certain medications. All of these medications are prescribed by your veterinarian, and your doctor will weigh the pros and cons of taking them.

### 1.5 Keep your cat away from seeing other cats or other animals.

### 1.6 Encourage good bonding between cats. 

If you plan to have more cats, try to find one that seems like you will get along well with the cat you have. Have them play the same toy together, eating together in separate bowls. If you create a friendly environment for two cats (or more), they will get along and are less likely to spray urine. However, the more cats you have in your home, the more likely they are to spray urine. This is due to physical stress and good indoor locations. It is known that if there are five or more cats in the house, at least one will be sprayed.

Anxiety plays a role in many unwanted cat behaviors, including spraying and aggression. Synthetic cat pheromones, such as Feliway, can help calm cats and create a more comfortable environment for them.
