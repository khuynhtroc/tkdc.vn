If you see cats using your garden as a toilet or nibbling on plants in your garden, you may be anxious to find a way to stop this mischief. You can choose to erect a fence, make your garden less attractive to cats, or scare them away. If all else fails, you may have to try to keep the peace and negotiate with the cats by setting aside an area for them to use at will.

## 1. Build obstacles

### 1.1 Create obstacles with a plastic fork or wooden chopsticks. 

Without enough space to scratch, dig, and move, the cats will find somewhere else to go to the bathroom. You can use a tree, fork, chopstick, or similar object (about 25 cm long) to stick in the ground about 20 cm apart to stop the cats.
- Be sure to dig a few centimeters deep into the ground to keep the materials upright.
- The materials shouldn't be too sharp to hurt but should be sharp enough to discourage your feline friends.

### 1.2 Place the wire mesh on the ground. 

Place wire mesh (available at home stores) on the ground before the plants sprout and stick out of the ground. Trees can grow through mesh crevices, but cats find it uncomfortable to walk on wire mesh. The wire mesh isn't as hard as hurting the cats, but enough to keep them from digging in your garden.
- If your tree needs more space to grow, you can use wire scissors to cut the plots right above the tree.
- You can replace the wire mesh with plastic panels designed for use in the garden.

### 1.3 Place the lattice fence on the ground. 

- Place the lattice fence on the ground before sowing the seeds. Gaps in the fence will make wandering cats lose interest in that area.
- Press down lightly on the fence so that the soil partially covers the fence.
- Plant seedlings and sow seeds in the fences. Common garden plants will slowly grow around the fence without a hitch.

### 1.4 Cover any material that is uncomfortable with the cat. 

The cat will not dig or play on rough surfaces. You can coat your yard with a thin layer of materials such as:
- Coarse coating
- Pineal
- Pebbles and rocks

### 1.5 Cover the ground with "repellent carpet". 

A "repellent mat" (available at garden stores) is a carpet with plastic spikes on its surface. The material is soft and won't hurt cats, but cats don't like the material and will stay away.
- Depending on the brand, this carpet is available in packs of 2 or 5 pieces. Usually, the rugs are cut in quarters to easily fit the size of the garden and your needs.
- Don't put a sketchy carpet on the ground. You need to press down so that the carpet is firmly attached to the ground, leaving only the spikes emerging. If not, a smart cat could turn the mat over.

### 1.6 Make a fence.

Cats are persistent creatures and can sneak around in many places. However, a 2 m high fence with 5 x 5 cm meshes can effectively prevent cats from entering your garden. You can add a 60 cm wide overhang for even more protection.

### 1.7 Use low voltage fencing. 
An electric fence that surrounds your garden can be very effective at repelling cats. Low voltage will do no harm, only chase the cats away. The fence only needs to rise about 10 cm above the ground to prevent cats from entering your garden.
- Look for electric fences at building materials and interior stores. Be careful when installing and using it safely according to the instructions.
- Do not let children get near electric fences.

## 2. Repel cats with the scent

![Keep-Cats-Out-of-a-Garden-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-keep-cats-out-of-the-garden/v4-728px-Keep-Cats-Out-of-a-Garden-Step-8-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Plant a fragrant tree. 

There are some plants that the cat does not like and will avoid. These trees, when planted, will make the whole area uncomfortable for the surrounding cats. Try planting one or more of the following plants near your garden, squeezing between plants or other areas in your yard that you don't want your cat to disturb:
- Lavender
- Nine Ly Huong
- Geranium
- Sage
- Lime thyme
- Rose thorns
- Coleus Canina, also known as the "cat chase tree"

![Keep-Cats-Out-of-a-Garden-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-keep-cats-out-of-the-garden/v4-728px-Keep-Cats-Out-of-a-Garden-Step-9-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Use dry herbs or aromatic essential oils. 

If you don't want to grow herbs or other cat repellants, you can sprinkle dry herbs or their essential oils around your garden for the same effect.
- Lavender and dried thyme are available online or at some garden supply stores. Lavender, lemongrass, citrus, and eucalyptus oils are available at supermarkets or beauty and wellness stores.
- You can also try applying essential oils to the walls of the pots.
- If you can't find the above herbs or essential oils, you can sprinkle cayenne peppers just like you sprinkle with dried herbs - just as well.

### 2.3 Sprinkle citrus peels around the garden. 

Most cats hate the smell of citrus. A quick and easy way to treat it is to sprinkle it on the garden with lemon, orange, grapefruit, or other citrus fruits, fresh or dried. Cats won't hurt, but the citrus scent will make them go away and look elsewhere.

![Keep-Cats-Out-of-a-Garden-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-keep-cats-out-of-the-garden/v4-728px-Keep-Cats-Out-of-a-Garden-Step-11-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 Try ground coffee or tobacco. 

Most cats hate the smell of coffee and tobacco as much as they hate citrus. Simply sprinkle a thin layer of ground coffee or tobacco thread directly onto the ground.

![Keep-Cats-Out-of-a-Garden-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-keep-cats-out-of-the-garden/v4-728px-Keep-Cats-Out-of-a-Garden-Step-12-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.5 Use a cat repellant that contains predator urine. 

Cat repellant sprays are available at many gardening stores. Look for "natural" ones that contain the urine content of foxes or other predators.
- These products contain natural ingredients that can repel other animals like squirrels and rabbits. Always use caution according to the instructions.

![Keep-Cats-Out-of-a-Garden-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-keep-cats-out-of-the-garden/v4-728px-Keep-Cats-Out-of-a-Garden-Step-13-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.6 Sprinkle hair around the garden. 

In theory, many wild cats do not like the smell of human hair. So you can keep cats away in the neighborhood by spreading your hair around the garden.
- Pick up the hairs from the comb or tell the barber to save it for you. Sprinkle each pinch of hair around the garden.
- This method may not be effective at repelling domestic cats (including your own) as they are used to the smell of human hair.

![Keep-Cats-Out-of-a-Garden-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-keep-cats-out-of-the-garden/v4-728px-Keep-Cats-Out-of-a-Garden-Step-14-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.7 Wash off any cat odors. 

If a cat has marked territory in your garden, you need to wash off its scent before it tries to move away. You can spray or pour white vinegar around the area where the cat has attempted to "claim" to prevent it from returning to the site again.
- Scare the cat and leave

![Keep-Cats-Out-of-a-Garden-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-keep-cats-out-of-the-garden/v4-728px-Keep-Cats-Out-of-a-Garden-Step-15-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Use a hose to spray the cats. 

If you are on guard, you can just spray the cats with a hose every time they destroy your garden. Cats can be taught, so if you persevere, it can also keep cats away.
- Be gentle when using a cat spray. Most cats are afraid of water, so a quick and light jet of water will suffice - you don't have to use a strong water hose or soak any cats that enter your garden.

![Keep-Cats-Out-of-a-Garden-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-keep-cats-out-of-the-garden/v4-728px-Keep-Cats-Out-of-a-Garden-Step-16-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Use a motion-activated spray. 
Motion-activated nozzles can be found in home stores. When the cat passes by, its movement will trigger the spray and the water will splash out. Cats are often afraid of water, so this can be an effective remedy. You can use multiple sprays to make a perimeter around the garden.
- This type of nozzle can be installed permanently or temporarily, depending on your preferences and needs.

![Keep-Cats-Out-of-a-Garden-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-keep-cats-out-of-the-garden/v4-728px-Keep-Cats-Out-of-a-Garden-Step-17-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Use the ultrasound device to keep cats away. 

This device emits high-frequency sounds that cannot be heard by humans but frighten cats. These are motion-activated devices, so when cats pass by, they will be startled by high-frequency sounds and discard them. Shop for the appliance at pet stores and use it as a barrier around the garden.

![Keep-Cats-Out-of-a-Garden-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-keep-cats-out-of-the-garden/v4-728px-Keep-Cats-Out-of-a-Garden-Step-18-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Breeding dogs. 

Cats will not hang out in places they feel unsafe because of predators. So a dog that can chase a cat can prevent the cat from going into your garden.

## 4. Use peaceful means

![Keep-Cats-Out-of-a-Garden-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-keep-cats-out-of-the-garden/v4-728px-Keep-Cats-Out-of-a-Garden-Step-19-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Make a sandbox for the cat. 

You can make an outdoor “toilet” for cats with a sandbox that is at least as large as a large cat litter box. Fill the box with soft, fine sand (you can purchase each bag at the home furnishing and building store) that your cat loves. If you're lucky, cats will be more attracted to the sandbox than the garden and will use the litter box when trying to poop.
- Remember to change and often; otherwise, the cats may return to your yard.
- Do not let children play near the sandbox and be sure to teach children not to play sand.

![Keep-Cats-Out-of-a-Garden-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-keep-cats-out-of-the-garden/v4-728px-Keep-Cats-Out-of-a-Garden-Step-20.jpg.webp)

### 4.2 Attract your cat to the cat zone. 

If you want your cat to stay out of the garden but don't mind if he is in other areas of the yard, you can try creating a cat-friendly area. Cats will be attracted to areas where some species of trees grow, and hopefully, they will leave the rest of your yard. Make a small plot of land and plant one of the following non-poisonous plants: 
- Grass cat (Nepeta cataria)
- Cat Mint (Nepeta mussinii)
- Cat thyme (Teucrium marum)
- Valerian (Valeriana officinalis)
- Spider cord (Chlorophytum comosum)

### 4.3 Move the bird feeder to another place. 

If you keep your bird feeder near your garden, move to a further area in the yard. It is best to hang the bird feeder high up where the cat cannot get in. Otherwise, the birds that come looking for food will be more dangerous than your garden.
