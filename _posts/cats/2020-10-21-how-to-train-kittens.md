> Cats are not puppies, and therefore training a cat is not the same as training a dog. In general, cat training is more challenging for people who are accustomed to training dogs or other animals, as kittens are more independent and less attentive to human commands than animals. other farming. However, with the right technique and patience, you can train your kitten to be a happy, healthy, and mostly obedient companion.

## 1. Learn to adapt to cats

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-1]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-1-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 1.1 Allow the mother to acclimatize her kittens for at least eight weeks. 

It usually takes at least two months for a kitten to adjust to the mother before becoming independent. During this time, the mother cat will do most of the "training", and you can provide extra support to help the kitten have the right way of functioning.
- Kittens will start weaning in about a month and should be completely weaned and should eat solid foods by eight weeks of age.
- If the mother cat has given birth to a litter of kittens and you are wearing them, then you should wait at least two months before separating them completely from the mother. The mother cat will train the kitten to know its strengths, to eat properly, and to use the litter box.

### 1.2 Avoid buying kittens that are weaned too early. 

If you are buying kittens from the store, you need to determine their exact age. Kittens weaned too early tend to be more aggressive and require more training than kittens to wean properly.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-3]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-3-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 1.3 Continue to adapt your kitten. 

The ideal pets are those that are able to adapt as a child. Well-adapted kittens will allow many people - young and old, regardless of gender and appearance, to have close contact starting at 2 weeks of age. This exposure should take place every day, preferably for 5 - 10 minutes at least twice a day - more often, better.
- If the kittens do not adapt and are familiar with humans, you will face a difficult struggle in the process of training them. This is because kittens will be alert and distrustful of humans. So your first task is to win the kittens' trust.
- If the kittens are more than 8 weeks old but still not familiar with humans, they may behave like feral cats or "wild" cats. Unfortunately, once this behavior is reinforced it is difficult to break, and it is likely that kittens will not be able to adapt to the human world.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-4]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-4-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 1.4 Be patient while adapting to the kitten. 

You can't force them to do anything, and so your weapon is patience and rewards when the kittens are around so they begin to bond you with beautiful experiences.
- Some examples include lying on the floor while you watch TV and holding a treat in your hand or in your pocket. This pose is less threatening, so the kitten will be curious and come towards you. Put treats on the floor for your cat's audacity and you can help him connect people with good food, and make the kitten more willing to approach you.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-5]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-5-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 1.5 Practice positive behavior. 

Rubbing your cat's face or yelling loudly is not the right way to train a kitten. Positive behavior is achieved through rewarding behaviors that you want your cat to repeat, letting them get rid of the bad behavior. This is the easiest way to change your cat's behavior.
- In case the cat does something you don't like, ignore it. Often times, standing groaning at the door or scratching hard at something is one way to get your attention. If it doesn't work, the cat will soon give up the behavior entirely.
- The reward could be delicious food. Most cats have a "must-have" reward. If they don't like the food, try a variety of foods to see what interests them.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-6-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 1.6 Do not punish the kitten. 

Punishing kittens can improve their appearance, but they will become more devious. Take, for example, when a cat pee on the mat in the waiting room. If you punish or scare the kitten, they will associate the punishment with you rather than urinating on the carpet. Therefore, the kitten will be careful not to pee in front of you in the future.
- This can also be counterproductive because kittens are more likely to find a discreet place to urinate, or alternatively, do not use the litter box while you are nearby because they are more vigilant. with your employer.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-7-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 1.7 Make a mother cat sound when you are not accepting the kitten's behavior. 

When the mother cat punishes the kitten, she will make a sound by pressing the mimetic throat. This method is effective and similar to training a kitten is trying to practice the basic behavior they are already familiar with.
- You can do this by clicking her tongue on the palate when the kitten is scratching or is behaving against indoor rules.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-8-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 1.8 Use catmint leaves during training. 

This method can be extremely effective, and rewarding the kitten is more effective than screaming. This can be a great way to attract your cat to a designated spot for the claw, the toy you want them to play with, or encourage them to sleep in the area you want. Putting some catmint leaves in a bag can help keep your cat entertained for hours.
- Not all cats are attracted to cat peppermint, and this makes training a little more difficult. If the cat doesn't seem interested, you can use something else it likes, such as a food reward, to draw it towards a certain object.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-9-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 1.9 Make plenty of space for the kitten. 

If the cat always climbed onto the counter to observe a scene or approach a restricted area, then intimidating it would not work. This will only make the cat more afraid of you. Instead, place a pad or bench in the vicinity, or spread catmint leaves or treats on it, so the cat can jump up and see the entire area from above.
- Make it clear that this is a cat zone. If the cat jumps on the counter again, you should move them to the bench.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-10-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 1.10 Play with the kitten often. 

To prevent your cat from behaving inappropriately, incorporate the practice into its eating habits. Before each meal, spark their hunting instincts by playing with strings, ribbons, laser pens, or some other toy your cat likes. This is an essential part of your cat's daily routine. Without it, they can become irritable or over-excited.
- Bring out a toy and ask the kitten to jump around, then let the cat grab the toy and start feeding. Usually, after a meal, a cat will groom and sleep after a meal. Play for at least 20 minutes a day, or until the kitten stops.

## 2. Train Your Cat To Eat

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-11-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Imagine that you only need to keep the food ready and the kitten can feed on its own. 

There are two basic philosophies when it comes to feeding a cat, and much of it will depend on how the cat eats. In general, most cats can be continuous or time-specific, but not both. Some cats are more likely to eat prepared food on their own, at which point they will eat until they are no longer hungry. This is probably the easiest method for you, as long as the cat has proper food intake control.
- When food is readily available, this is called spontaneous feeding. This process mimics the way a cat eats in nature by eating snacks regularly. Cats are not bored and playful and provide mental stimulation often have the ability to control calories and can use spontaneous feeding.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-12-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Feed your cat regularly if it tends to overeat.

Problems can arise in cases where the cat is bored or irritated, and in that case, eating can become a hobby and the cat loses control of its calories.
- Usually, these are cats that groan when their food is not prepared. So you need to start feeding on a regular schedule. Kittens usually need to be fed four times a day until they are 12 weeks old, and then 3 times a day until 6 months of age. After this age adult cats can eat twice daily, morning and evening. Do this at the same time each day.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-13-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Give your cat the right food. 

Kittens often double or triple their weight during the first few weeks of development, meaning kittens need to be on a higher calorie and fat diet compared to adult cats. Commercial foods are usually separated by the age of the cat, and it is recommended that you feed your kitten with kittens manufactured foods.
- Don't give your kitten adult or old cat food, and vice versa. The amount of calories in different foods is completely different and can lead to malnutrition, if the kitten eats adult cat food, or is overweight due to the adult cat eating the adult cat food. Kitty.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-14-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 Always provide your cat with clean water. 

Cats will start whining if they don't have what they need, and this whining can turn into a long-term unpleasant habit. If you don't want to have to retrain your kittens, do it right from the start. If a cat knows that the water bowl will refill before it runs out, they won't whine to remind you to change the water. You should do this before the cat reminds you.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-15-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.5 Do not feed your cat any food on the table. 

Besides the fact that kittens should not eat a lot of human food, such as garlic, onions, chocolate, grapes, and raisins that are toxic to cats, sit on the table and put the food down for them. will make the kitten get in the habit of climbing every time you are eating her meal. Only give the kitten cat food, and at the right times.
- Never give your cat milk. Despite the common misconception that cats should drink milk, these drinks make them indigestible, and as a result, they will go to the toilet a lot and you will have to work hard to clean the litter box. the next day.
- Cats should only eat tuna occasionally once or twice a week. Many cats love canned fish, but these foods do not contain the necessary nutrients for their health, and an increasingly common phenomenon is that some cats may be overly addicted to fish. tuna, and ignore other foods that provide more nutrients. It's like people don't like to eat anything but chips.

## 3. Train Your Cat Using the litter box

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-16-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Prepare a simple toilet tray. 

Simple designs are usually most cat-friendly. A simple litter box with clean soil is an attractive environment for your cat to defecate. If you buy a complicated automatic litter box, then your cat can feel intimidated and intimidated by using them.
- Likewise, the litter box with a lid on top keeps dirt and waste from falling out, but it also makes it difficult for cats to access the litter box. If you're struggling to get your cat to use a tray, go for a simple one without a lid.
- If you don't want to shovel the dung, don't keep a cat. There are a variety of versatile temporary replacements and products designed to make cleaning easier, but the reality of the matter is that you need to clean up after the cat poop to help them. always be happy.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-17-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Put the kitten in the litter box. 

If you want the cat to use the tray, all you need to do is put it in it. Cats want to deal with the sadness in the litter box, so it's not difficult to put them in the litter box once to show you how to poop in the right place.
- Some coaches suggest that you sit with your cat and ask her to dig a few times to get used to the feeling and environment. This can trigger an instinctive response to dig and fill your cat's feces after using the tray.
- If the kitten feels uncomfortable when you hold her back and do digging, stop using this method.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-18-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Place the toilet tray in a quiet place, ideally located in the corner of the room. 

This is a good place to be, as kittens often find it vulnerable to poop. With walls on either side, the cat only needs to observe the predator approaching from the front.
- In addition, you should not place the cleaning tray next to the washing machine or any other device that causes sudden noise or movement. If the device works while the cat is pooping, the cat will panic, and will no longer use the tray.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-19.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Clean out cleaning trays often. 

Cats, even kittens, want to use a litter box, and they shouldn't have trouble getting in. The main reason cats begin to pee or defecate outside of the litter box is that they feel they can't use the tray. This could be because the litter box is difficult to access, you change the toilet soil too often, or the litter box is too dirty.
- Sanitary trays need to be cleaned every day. Use a shovel to scoop up feces and urine, and change the toilet soil regularly to keep the tray clean. If you smell the unpleasant stench of the litter box, then the cat will smell the same. You should keep this in mind.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-20.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Use sanitary soil regularly. 

Changing your litter box can be confusing for cats. Ideally, you should use sanitary soil made from natural pine to provide the best environment.
- Avoid using scented toilet soil. This scent can be pleasant but is too overwhelming for kittens, as they have a sensitive sense of smell. This can prevent them from using the litter box.
- Use enough clean soil for the litter box to give your cat room to dig. The cat doesn't want to scratch the soil around her own urine as much as you want.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-21]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-21.jpg.webp)

### 3.6 Do not put anything in the cleaning tray on the ground. 

Don't try to entice your cat to use the litter box by placing toys, treats, or food in the ground. Cats do not want to eat and drink where they go to the toilet, and placing food on a tray will make them feel confused about where to poop.

## 4. Train Kittens with Switch

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-22]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-22.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Use switch training when the cat is young.

It's an ideal time to start training with the switch. The switch makes a keystroke-like sound you use to mark the exact moment the behavior you want the cat to repeat. This is a great way to teach your cat to do tricks or even use things like getting close to you when called.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-23]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-23.jpg.webp)

### 4.2 Combine switches with rewards. 

Start by clicking the switch and then reward the cat. When you press the button and then give the treat to the cat, they connect the sound and the reward. Once the kitten is starting to walk towards you in anticipation of a reward, press the switch, and then hand out the reward. Repeat this step until you are sure they have learned how to match sounds and rewards.
- Rewarding food is ideal, but some cats have no interest in the food. However, each cat has at least one food they absolutely love, so you just need to figure out what it is.
- Experiment with different foods including ham, tuna, chicken, fish, beef, and shrimp. You will find your cat's favorite food, as the food will disappear within seconds and the kitten will meow for more searching.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-24]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-24.jpg.webp)

### 4.3 Train at a time when the kitten's belly is not full, as a full stomach will upset the kitten's spirits for a treat. 

To start, reward the kittens, and when they grab it, click the switch immediately. Repeat 3 or 4 times, then let the kitten rest for the next training session. Repeat.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-25]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-25.jpg.webp)

### 4.4 Mark the behavior you want with the click sound of the switch. 

Once the kitten associates the click sound with the reward, you can adjust the pressing to decrease the value of the reward, only when the kitten is behaving well.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-26]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-26.jpg.webp)

### 4.5 Connect a click sound to signal good behavior with a reward once the behavior is completed. 

You can even associate the behavior with a word like "Sit", to complete the training.

## 5. Training a Kitten Closer to Command

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-27]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-27.jpg.webp)

### 5.1 Persistently train the kitten to come when called, although it can take some time and effort. 

It's a great idea to get a kitten up close when called it. This step is extremely helpful and can help you find the cat if it gets lost.
- In many cases, stray kittens are frightened and instinctively hide as a defense mechanism. However, if the kitten is trained to return on command, this may overcome the natural tendency to stay still in a frightening situation.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-28]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-28.jpg.webp)

### 5.2 Train in short but regular sessions. 

When training a kitten, you will need to master the concept of training little but often. Cats have a shorter tempo than dogs and their ability to concentrate and begin to roam after 5 minutes or so. A suitable schedule would be sessions of three or five minutes a day, or alternatively, schedule arbitrary short sessions as often as possible when a kitten is nearby and in a good mood.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-29]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-29.jpg.webp)

### 5.3 Choose a word you use to call the kitten. 

As the kitten comes toward you, you'll provide a decisive word to use to call the cat. Choose a word that the kitten cannot hear under any circumstances, so unusual or even self-made words are ideal.
- It is best NOT to use the name of the cat as it will be used in other cases. This will be confusing for cats, because if they have no forward reflexes when you say, "Kitty is a beautiful cat," it will dilute the suggestion.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-30]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-30.jpg.webp)

### 5.4 Use switch training to train your cat to be on command. 

Speak the cue and when the kitten turns towards you, briefly press the switch to time the desired behavior. Then immediately reward them. If you repeat this regularly, over many training sessions, the cat will learn from this suggestion.
- You can use this rule to train your cat to do any desired behavior, such as jumping off a desk or shaking its paw.

## 6. Training Kittens Sharpen the nails in the right place

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-31]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-31.jpg.webp)

### 6.1 Make space for the kitten to nail it. 

If you are worried about your cat scratching his clothes or furniture, you need to allow her to sharpen her claws elsewhere. In general, pillars studded with catmint leaves or cardboard paper linings with catmint leaves underneath are ideal areas for a scratching kitten.
- Cats need to keep their claws sharp and healthy, which means they need to scratch the surface of objects. It is futile to punish cats for scratching because they are not malice. Cats scratch because they are required to do so.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-32]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-32.jpg.webp)

### 6.2 Reward your cat for scratching it in the right place. 

If you see your cat sharpening its claws in a designated area, give them a small reward for repeating the behavior in the future.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-33]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-33.jpg.webp)

### 6.3 Hold the spray bottle in your hand. 

A good way to prevent your cat from scratching or scratching important objects is to keep the spray bottle in hand and gently spray it on any scratching behavior. This will have the effect of chasing them out of the area immediately. After spraying the cat with water, hide the sprayer. If the cat knows it is you, it may become scared.

![Train-a-Kitten-Step-34]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-kittens/v4-728px-Train-a-Kitten-Step-34.jpg.webp)

### 6.4 Apply peppermint oil on something you don't want the kitten to scratch. 

Apply a small amount of essential oil, usually peppermint, over the area where you want the cat to be out and tear the furniture. This is an effective way to keep your kitten away from any objects you don't want them to touch.
- The scent is a natural cat repellent. They simply don't like this smell. It doesn't harm the kittens, it just smells unpleasant.
- You should be careful when applying essential oils to surfaces that can be damaged. Apply a small amount on the hidden corner to check before applying oil to the surface of the drum.

> Advice
- Have fun with the kitten by waving a towel or string in front of them. The cat will love you for this action.
- Watch the kittens carefully, assessing their bad and good habits. Think about ways to correct bad habits and reinforce good habits.
- If you are gentle with kittens, they will be gentler and kinder to you.
- Play with kittens often and call out their names so they know it's their own.
- Do not lock or lock the kitten in a small cage. They will squeal and may bite.

> Warning
- Always be patient! Kittens may not learn the lesson quickly, but training them won't waste your time.
