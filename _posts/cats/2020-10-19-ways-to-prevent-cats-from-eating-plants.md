## 1. Prevent Plants Damaging Behavior

### 1.1 Hanging plants from the ceiling. 

You can purchase hanging and hooking pots from the ceiling or garden. Hanging pots are both beautiful and can prevent cats from being spoiled!

### 1.2 Spray your cat repellant on plants. 

You can buy sprays at the pet store that won't harm plants but will keep your cat away from them. One safe product label is “Get Off,” but you should check the label before buying a cat repellant. Some sprays are potentially harmful to plants.
- You can make your own at home spray. Mix one part vinegar with three parts water and spray on the leaves. Cats don't like this smell so they won't destroy your plants!

### 1.3 Train your cat to stay away from plants. 

This method will work well with "remote punishment." The goal is to make the cat associate approaching the plant with something bad, like getting sprayed in the face with water. However, you shouldn't get the cat to associate the punishment with you. You need to keep your cat from knowing where the punishment is coming from.
- Trap the bonsai by placing a sensor-activated compressed air tank near it. These cat training aids can be purchased at a pet store or online.
- When the cat approaches the plant, it will be exposed to the compressed air. This does not hurt them but will cause the cat to hesitate about whether to approach the bonsai again.

### 1.4 Don't punish the cat yourself. 

For example, if you spray the cat with water or scold the cat, it will associate the punishment with you. Cats may also stop eating plants when you are present, but they will continue to be vile when you leave the room. Punishing cats really only makes them more clever. Your cat may be more afraid of you, and this is something you don't want to happen in a relationship with your pet.

### 1.5 Cover the plant with offensive material. Place foil around the base of the plant, or the plastic carpet protector with the spiky side facing up. Your cat may not like to walk on an annoying surface to get to the plants.

### 1.6 Use noise to stop your cat.

Collect and clean empty cans - canned vegetables or soft drinks. Stack the cans along the edge of the table where you placed the plants, then stack more rows on top to form a wall. When your cat jumps up and spills the can, the noise will startle her. Then the cat will not dare to approach the plant again after being scared to death.

### 1.7 Sprinkle lion manure into the soil in the plant's pot. 

This may seem odd, but products like Silent Roar contain lion feces. Although you won't be able to smell it, the cat has a fairly sensitive sense of smell, and they will receive a warning that another more powerful species claims the potted plant as part of its territory.

## 2. Provide other Toys for Cats

### 2.1 Understand the reasons behind bonsai destructive behavior. 

Cats can feel overwhelmingly bored when locked up in your home. If a moving tree leaf is the closest thing to a toy or prey in its surroundings, then you shouldn't be surprised if your cat is attracted to the plant. To get the most out of your pest treatment, you'll need to buy your cat a different toy specifically for it.

### 2.2 Play with your cat often. 

Some cat breeds are more active than others, so you'll determine how much time they need to play with. However, as a general rule, you should play with your cat at least twice a day for 5-10 minutes each time.

### 2.3 Use toys that get your cat active. 

While your cat will love the attention, don't turn playtime into cuddling times. You need to get your cat excited and active to prevent her from chewing on your plants.
- Use a toy with a long string so that your cat can run from room to room without getting overwhelmed.
- Not all cats are attracted to laser beams, but if so, you're in luck! You can lie down in bed and enjoy a snack while the cat runs around trying to catch the little red dot!

### 2.4 Bring toys out for your cat while you are out and about. 

Cats can become bored when there's no one around to play with. Bringing a toy out to your cat while alone helps to overcome boredom instead of chewing on plants.
- Change toys often so your cat won't get bored with playing with one thing every day. Your cat will ignore a toy when it becomes too familiar.
- However, if the toy hasn't been played in a while, the cat will feel excited when the old toy reappears.

## 3. Choose Bonsai

### 3.1 Observe your cat's preferences. 

Pay attention to plants that attract your cat's attention, then avoid keeping them indoors.
- Cats, for example, are often attracted to thin leafy plants that sway in the wind.
- If this is the case, buy a plant with a large, heavy leaf blade that will not attract the cat near.

### 3.2 Avoid buying "cat magnet" plants. Cats cannot resist the yucca and will chew on them mercilessly. Zinnia and marigolds are other examples of "cat magnet" plants that you should avoid.

If you buy plants that your cat is interested in keeping indoors, place them on a high shelf where the cat cannot reach them. Make sure the cat is incapable of jumping on the shelf, otherwise it will bounce off and destroy your tree.

### 3.3 Place "bait" plants around your home. 

You can take advantage of your cat's attraction to specific plants. Place a tray of catmint leaves or grass around your cat's home. Chewing these plants will help satisfy their needs, and hopefully, make them lose interest in other plants.

### 3.4 Buy plants that your cat doesn't like. 

There are also some plants that the cat cannot seem to eat. They often have a strong smell, like lavender, rosemary, or citrus plants. While you can enjoy the scent of this plant, the cat will not like to chew on it.
- You can also buy plants with leaves that are overhead that the cat cannot reach, such as small trees.

> Warning
- Never spray the plant or soil with a substance that could harm the cat, such as hot sauce. It can stop cats, but can also stick eyes and fur and cause damage or even loss of vision.
- Only use products that are guaranteed by your veterinarian to be safe for the cat. Also, always spray a small amount onto the plant before applying the product over the entire plant to ensure that the plant is not damaged.
- Stay up to date with a list of poisonous plants (you can find them online) and avoid placing them indoors as plants, even if they are away from cats. Cats have a knack for jumping in places you would never think they could reach or consider to be safe. Accidental poisoning should not be facilitated by the presence of toxic plants anywhere in the home.
- You can stop the cat by placing the mantle in the pot; However, the blade is a poison, and cats can become seriously ill or die if they ingest the chemicals. If you decide to use the plates, place them inside a container with holes in them so that the steam can escape, but your cat won't be able to access the plates.
