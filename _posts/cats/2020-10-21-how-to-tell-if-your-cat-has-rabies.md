title: "How to tell if your cat has rabies?"
summary: Every year, the United States has several cases of cats with rabies. Cats become rabies because they have not been vaccinated, or the vaccines on cats have become ineffective and they have come into contact with wild animals that are carriers of rabies. If you come into contact with a cat that is suspected of being infected with rabies, there will be certain signs of the disease that you can spot on the animal. Always take extreme care and do not try to catch cats that are at risk of infection. Contact animal control, a local wildlife organization, or call the police on the non-emergency line.

## 1. Detect the symptoms of rabies

### 1.1 Watch for early symptoms of rabies. 

The incubation period can last from two to ten days. During this time, the cat will experience a slight change in physical condition with ambiguous symptoms. Early non-obvious symptoms include:
- muscle pain
- jitter
- easily irritable
- shiver
- fever
- malaise, a common condition that occurs when a cat is sick and upset
- light phobia, extreme phobia with lights
- loss of appetite, or lack of interest in food
- vomiting
- diarrhea
- asthma cough
- unable or unwilling to chew and swallow

### 1.2 Check for bites or signs of a fight on the cat's body. 

If you think your cat may have been in contact with an animal with rabies, check to see if he has a bite or signs of a fight. The rabies virus can live on the cat's skin or fur for up to two hours, so wear gloves and wear long sleeves and pants before handling your cat. Saliva from an infected animal can be passed on to healthy animals through the bite. When pathogens enter the body, the rabies virus travels along the nerves to the spinal cord and then to the brain. Take your cat to the veterinarian right away if you notice any of these signs:
- bites
- scales
- scratches
- ruffled fur with dry saliva
- lots of latex

### 1.3 Look for symptoms of “dumb” or paralytic rabies. 

The wild type is a common wild type in cats. A cat with lethargic rabies will show signs of lethargy, panic, and moodiness. In this wild form, cats are usually not aggressive and rarely bite. Symptoms of "dumb" or paralytic rabies include:
- paralysis (unable to move) of a leg, jaw muscle, or part of the body
- Jaw dropped, looking "frozen".
- drool and foam around the mouth
- difficulty chewing swallowing

### 1.4 You should take extra care if your cat has rabies. 

A cat with a frantic rabies form is often aggressive, exhibits unusual behavior, and is frothy. When it comes to rabies, most people often think of these behaviors, but the frantic form of the feline is usually less common than the dumbbell. Call animal control for assistance if you think your cat has rabies. A cat with rabies will attack, so don't try to catch the cat yourself. Signs of madness include:
- drool like foam around the edge
- afraid of water, seeming afraid of approaching water, or being afraid of the sound of water
- fierce, for example, bared teeth as if they were about to bite
- jitter
- Don't care about food
- Biting or attacking
- unusual behavior, such as self-biting

## 2. Treat a cat with rabies

### 2.1 Call animal control if you spot a cat showing signs of infection. 

Don't try to catch a rabid cat on your own. If you see symptoms of infection on a cat, your best bet is to contact animal control. That way, the cat will be taken to the vet without endangering you.
- You should contact animal control if your cat is behaving strangely or is aggressive.

### 2.2 Take the cat to see the vet. 

If your cat has been bitten by another cat or another animal, put it in a cage and bring it to the vet as soon as possible. Your veterinarian will ask you about possible rabies exposure (a persistent odor in the yard, possible exposure to raccoons, or any bats in the area) and monitor domestic cats’ friends.
- Remember, there is no live animal test to determine which animal is infected with rabies. To diagnose rabies, the brain will be removed from the body, small parts of the brain will be viewed under a microscope to detect the presence of Negri body.

### 2.3 Ask for a rabies booster shot for your cat. 

If your cat has been previously vaccinated against rabies, he will receive a booster shot of the rabies vaccine right after being bitten. This will help your cat's immune system fight off the virus. You should watch for signs of rabies in cats for 45 days. You can do this at home as long as your cat is locked away and away from any outside animals or humans.

### 2.4 Be aware that the euthanasia method may be needed. 

- If the cat has not been vaccinated against rabies and has been bitten by other rabies-infected animals, euthanasia is recommended in this case. Rabies is a serious threat to human health and the cat will likely develop rabies as well.
- If the owner refuses to use euthanasia for the cat, it will need to be quarantined afterward and monitored for 6 months. This quarantine must be carried out at a veterinary clinic at the owner's expense.
- If the cat does not die from rabies during this time, the cat will be allowed to return home. One month before release, your cat will need a rabies vaccine.

## 3. Protect your cat from rabies

### 3.1 Make sure your cat has the latest rabies vaccine. 

Rabies vaccination for cats is the best and most valuable way to prevent rabies. In many countries, rabies vaccination is required by law.
- Schedule regular vaccinations with your veterinarian to keep the rabies vaccine effective for cats. Some vaccines need to be given every year, every two years, or every three years.

### 3.2 Keep the cat indoors. 

Another way to protect your cat from rabies is to isolate it from wildlife. Keeping your cat indoors is a good way because she won't have to come into contact with nearby animals that may be carrying rabies such as cats, raccoons, or others.
- If your cat has a habit of going out, you should only allow it to go out under your close supervision. Do not let the cat get close to any foreign animals. 

![Tell-if-a-Cat-Has-Rabies-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-tell-if-your-cat-has-rabies/v4-728px-Tell-if-a-Cat-Has-Rabies-Step-11.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Do not let wild animals enter your yard. 

Wild animals are often carriers of rabies. If your yard does not attract wildlife, your cat will have less exposure to infected animals. There are several things you can do to keep wildlife out of your yard:
- Close all trash cans.
- sure that there are no hiding places for American skunks or raccoons, like below the deck or your house.
- Build a fence to prevent wandering animals from sneaking into your yard.
- Plant trees and prune shrubs

> Advice
- Remember that age is not a factor in determining whether a cat is infected or not. Even kittens are susceptible to rabies.

> Warning
- Treat the bite by washing it with soap and water and immediately contact a doctor even if you don't think the animal is sick. The bite can become seriously infected if not treated right away. 
- You should be more careful with bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes. In the United States, they are the most common carriers of rabies. 
- Leave wild animals alone! This includes newborn animals. Even newborn animals can carry rabies. If you find a few newborn animals that have been abandoned by their mothers, you should call animal control or wildlife support and ask them to take care of the animal.
