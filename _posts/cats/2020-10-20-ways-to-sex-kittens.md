## 1. Judgment through the Genitals

### 1.1 Make sure the cat is in a warm and safe environment. 

Kittens are very susceptible to cold infections. Although they have a way to warm themselves, they still depend a lot on the mother's temperature. Separating kittens from their mother can be harmful to their health. Here are some tips to help you hold and check your kitten's sex without compromising immature resistance:
- Keep the kittens in a warm indoor place.
- Don't separate the little cats from their mothers for more than 5-10 minutes.
- Kittens should not be placed on an "absorbent" surface such as marble or hardwood floors, as they can get cold.

### 1.2 Gently lift the tail. 

Genital viewing is the most accurate way to determine a cat's sex. A kitten may be uncomfortable touching its tail (which is pretty straightforward). Remember to be gentle. Holding a cat slightly or too violently will cause pain and resistance. Especially not to grab the tail and lift it up because this part of the kitten is very weak.
- Calmly pet the cat for a while before placing it on a soft, clean towel. Lift up the cat's tail. If the kitten responds defensively, stop immediately and return it to the mother.
- Position the cat with its buttocks facing you.
- Lift the tail, not tug or pull.
- If the resisting kitten doesn't want anyone to touch its tail, have someone else pick it up while you gently examine it.
- You can try getting the cat to lift its tail by gently scratching the connection between the back and tail.
- Under the cat's tail, there are two holes. Above is the anus, while below is the male or female genitalia.

### 1.3 Check out the shape of the hole below. 

If you have a lot of cats, you can put two cats of the opposite sex side by side for direct comparison and it will be easy.
- The female cat's genitals are small, vertical slits. In general, the anus together with the organ will look like a lowercase "i".
- The male cat's reproductive organs are small, round holes. In general, the anus with this organ will look like a colon (:).

### 1.4 Consider the distance between the holes. 

In female cats, the anus and the reproductive organs are closer together than the male, you can use this to distinguish.
- The female cat's reproductive organs are close up and closer to her anus.
- The male cat's genitals lie downwards.

### 1.5 Examination of the testicles. 

The testicles of male kittens are usually not clear but can still be detected. However, never use force when handling a kitten's genitals. While their penis (which is usually hidden under the foreskin) can be pulled out to see it, do not do so as this can cause damage in the long run.
- Observe carefully the space between the two holes. If you see it bulging or looking like a small bag, it is probably a scrotum and this is a male.
- A kitten's genitals are often not so clear, so if you can't find anything, wait a month or two for them to grow. To feel the testicles, feel the space between the anus and genitals. You should see one or two pea-sized lumps. Be aware that a kitten's testicles are usually hidden under the groin skin and are difficult to perceive in cats younger than a month or two.

## 2. Judging by Other Characteristics

### 2.1 Certain distinctive coat colors have a clear gender. By looking at the coat color we can tell whether it is a male or a female.

Coat colors such as trichromats (multiple black, white, and orange patches) or golden brown (with black, orange / brown, and a little white) are recessive genes that are defined on the X chromosome. To express coat colors On the outside, they must go together to form XX pair (XX is female, XY is male). If you see a cat with colors of calico or golden brown, it is most likely a female, except in exceptional circumstances.
- Stripe/orange fur is usually a male.

### 2.2 Watch for signs during the heat. 

After about 6-10 (some species are earlier than 4) months of age, and unmarried females will show some folk signs called "male stick" (the scientific name of this period is "in heat"). A female cat can be in heat for 2-19 days. For female cats without a partner, the average time is 8 days. If they have a relationship with a male cat, it will promote ovulation, making the cycle shorter. The following characteristics manifest in offspring during the heat:
- Begins to "meow" each time loudly, often, and sounds harsh. Increasing intensity and sometimes like howling.
- A strong desire to go out.
- Showing an incredible affection even for inanimate objects.
- Occasionally show "ready position": stand leaning forward, hind legs spread out, buttocks up in the air.
- Primary shot out in rays.

### 2.3 Check for the smell of your urine. 

Male cats that are not castrated when becoming in heat often have a habit of urinating vigorously, splashes of urine, and an odor.
- Although well taught, they can pee even out of the toilet.
- Male urine during this time often smells very bad and unpleasant.

### 2.4 Evaluate your cat's body shape and facial features. 

Based on this, it will be difficult to tell the sex of your cat until it starts in heat. When the cat is old enough, we can see outward features such as:
- A male cat that is not castrated is usually low in fat and muscle with a thick skull and jawbones.
- You need to know about "tail fungus" in male cats. Some glands at the base of the tail secrete a substance called sebum. This substance acts on the skin near the base of the tail, causing the hair in this area to develop symptoms such as: oily, clumpy; hair falls thin and patchy; dotted blackheads; erythema, or skin infection; has a bad smell.

> Warning
- Avoid handling kittens that are less than three or four weeks old. Cats are too young to be able to retain the human breath, causing the mother to refuse because she does not recognize them. This can cause the kitten to die from lack of nutrition and warmth. 
- The kittens resist because they do not want you to be picked up, the mother may become angry and defenseless because she thinks her baby is in danger. Make sure the mother cat is comfortable when you take her baby away. If they are upset or upset, stop and return the kitten to the nest.
