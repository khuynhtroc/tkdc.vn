## 1. Understand your cat

### 1.1 Treat your cat like an independent animal.

Even though cats depend on your care, they still have a great need for independence and privacy. Although cats love to be petted, they often do not enjoy interacting with humans. If you can balance playing with your cat and giving her some private time, she will love you more.
- One of the most common mistakes pet owners make is to treat cats like dogs. Remember, they are two very different animals.
- Dogs are groups of animals domesticated to work with humans. In contrast, cats are solitary animals that help humans by eliminating harmful rodents alone.
- Don't get too attached to your cat or get frustrated when it comes to hiding you. That is part of their natural character.

### 1.2 Avoid using penalties. 

When cats are punished by yelling or other aggressive actions, they tend to run away. In general, cats fail to obey their owners through discipline. Your cat will not love you if you are a mean owner.
- Never hit a cat as this will only make things worse.
- While spraying a cat with water to punish its bad behavior is a common tactic, it will scare and distrust you.

### 1.3 Find a treat that your cat likes. 

Just like humans, there are some foods that cats enjoy over others. Find out what it is, and instead of punishing it, use it to encourage good behavior in your cat. Cats taste different, but small tuna cakes and cooked chicken are often difficult to resist for cats. Treating your cat from time to time will make him love you more.
- Do not give your cat milk. Contrary to popular belief, dairy is not good for cats.
- Do not feed your cat chocolate, candy, raw eggs, raw meat, or fish.
- Remember that junk food cannot replace a full cat meal.

### 1.4 Appreciate your cat's personality. 

Although cats share common behavioral traits, there are still significant differences between them. Take the time to find out what your cat likes and dislikes. Knowing and respecting your cat's personality is very important in winning a cat's affection.

## 2. Communicate with your cat

### 2.1 Learn and respect your cat's body language. 

Like humans, cats use body language as a way of communication to express every emotion, from the trust to fear. Their appearances contain important messages. For example:
- A curved back, upright hair down the spine, and spread of paws are all signs that your cat is feeling threatened. At this point, let the cat be alone.
- If your cat rubs you against you, it may want to play.
- If your cat has her tail wrapped around you, she is probably showing satisfaction.
- If the cat has its tail down or between its legs, it may be feeling anxious or restless

### 2.2 Listen to your cat's calls. 

The "purr" sound expresses love and satisfaction. Screams and screeches mean to stay away. The "meow" sound is the sound to attract attention, expressing everything from hunger to wanting to be stroked.
- Cats don't meow to each other, they do this to communicate with humans.
- Cats that continually meow may indicate that they are sick and should be seen by a cat

### 2.3 Avoid prolonged eye contact with the cat. 

This is polite when communicating with other people, but it's more threatening to a cat. If the cat blinks while you are there, that is a sign of trust.
- The next time the cat blinks at you, copy the action.
- By blinking slowly, you are showing confidence and openness, and cultivating feelings for your cat.

### 2.4 When picking up your cat, get down to its height first. 

Slowly bend over before picking up the cat. If your cat can see you before you are picked up, it will be less likely to be afraid.

## 3. Take care of your cat

### 3.1 Keep the cat out of danger. 

When your cat is safe and protected, it will love you more. Make sure your cat has a safe place to sleep, feels comfortable going to the bathroom, has adequate food, and is not intimidated by other people or animals in the house.
- Make sure the cat cannot come into contact with toxic substances.
- Close cabinets and lockers, as cats are curious animals and they can be in trouble.
- Have your cat wear a collar with an easy-to-remove lock (in case she gets stuck), with contact information on it in case the cat gets lost.

### 3.2 Feed your cat according to a schedule. 

Cats are creatures of habit. Don't change the feeding time of your cat too often. When your cat does a good job, reward the cat food, but don't let it interfere with the main meal. In order for your cat to love you more, don't change the type of food it is eating.
- Your cat will be completely healthy when it comes to dry food, canned food, or a combination of the two.
- Most experts recommend feeding your cat no more than two meals a day. One in five cats is obese in developed countries, causing serious health problems.

### 3.3 Don't mistreat your cat! 

When you leave home, make sure your cat has enough food and clean water. If you have to be away for a long time, make sure to have someone look after the cat, clean the litter box, and play with them a little. An abused cat will not love its owner.
- Although cats are independent animals, they still need human attention and regular cleaning.
- If you're on vacation, hire someone to look after the cat.

### 3.4 Clean the litter box regularly. 

Cats love cleanliness; if their litter box is dirty, they will find another place to go to the toilet. Add clean sand to the pot daily. Wash the sand basin often with soap and water. 
- Don't suddenly change your cat's litter type.
- When you want to change to a new type of sand, slowly mix old and new sand together.

### 3.5 Brush your cat often. 

They love it! Regular grooming helps their coat and skin stay healthy Brushing is also a great opportunity to spot lumps, lice, or wounds. Grooming is also an opportunity to become more intimate with your cat.
- Avoid brushing the cat's hair growth in reverse, which can be uncomfortable and stressful.
- Always brush gently with long strokes, instead of brushing short, rough hands.

### 3.6 Play with your cat.

Cats love simple, inexpensive toys - use stringed toys to pretend to be mice. Make the toy move as fast as a mouse or soar like a bird. The cat will eagerly chase the toy. Cats will love owners who play with them.
- Encourage your cat to pounce on toys, not your hands!

### 3.7 Invest in buying nail grinding columns. 

Cats have an instinct to sharpen their nails on surfaces in your home, like furniture. However, they may also enjoy scratching only certain objects, especially places with rough surfaces like thick carpet or papyrus. Cats will love you more if they have something suitable for nail polish indoors.

### 3.8 Buy or make your own "treehouse" for the cat, which is both a nail column and a playground for the cat. 

Your cat will love to climb and play with this toy.

### 3.9Take advantage of your cat's "love of food" traits. 

A lot of cats tend to love their feeders more than others. If your house is crowded, be the cat feeder. Your cat will get used to that and will always come to you when it's hungry or when it's time for dinner.
- The shortest way to reach a cat's heart is through its stomach!

> Advice
- These all take time. You cannot force your cat to love you.
- Scratch the cat all over to find out where it likes to be petted the most.
- Many cats love to be scratched under their chin.
- Be aware of signs when the cat no longer needs attention, such as petting. Some signs include: not purring, looking at you in a certain way, or simply getting up and walking away.
- Let the cat wrap around you, don't push it down from your lap.
- Give them snacks a few times a week.
- If the cat won't let you pick it up, stop trying, and the cat will become even angrier.
- When the cat hisses, let the cat be left alone.

> Warning
- If the cat hisses or raises his hand to scratch, stop touching the cat. That will make the cat angrier. Instead, leave the cat alone for a while and try again later.
- A cat that is seriously injured or ill may purr to calm itself. This is not an expression of satisfaction but the opposite. If your cat shows obvious unhappiness or defenseless behavior, but still purrs, you may want to seek medical attention.
- Never hold or pull a cat's tail, or cats don't like this.
