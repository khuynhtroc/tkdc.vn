## 1. Determine the cause of your cat's spraying

### 1.1 Know the difference between spraying and urinating. 

Spraying, also known as urine marking, is communication that can result from a variety of factors. In contrast, urination is caused by a natural need, usually only related to the problem of a litter box.
- Cats usually choose vertical surfaces to mark with urine. The amount of urine, in this case, is also less than when the cat pee normally.
- Cat-marked urine will have a stronger odor, which is because they release chemicals that send signals to other cats.
- Spraying is more common in male cats that are not castrated, in homes that have many cats and a change in the home.

### 1.2 Understand why a cat is spraying. 

To prevent this behavior, you must understand what causes your cat to do so. Spraying is one way for your cat to communicate with other cats, and the key to solving this problem is understanding what the cat is trying to convey.
- Cats are possessive and enjoy territorial claims. Urine marking is a way for your cat to let other cats know its presence and which areas of the house belong to it. If you have a lot of cats in your household, it is likely that the cat is “claiming ownership”.
- Spraying in the urine is also a mating behavior in cats. They do this during mating season, and the pheromones in the cat's urine send out the message that they're ready for reproduction. If your cat is not castrated, it can spray the urine for this reason.

### 1.3 Find out why cats are doing this behavior. 

Once you know the cause of your cat's spraying, ask yourself questions about your home. This will clear the cause of your cat's spraying.
- Does your home have a newborn baby or another pet? That way, perhaps your cat feels threatened and wants to mark its territory.
- Did a neighbor's cat come into your yard causing your cat to feel stressed?
- Are there any changes to your cat's routine? Cats don't like change, and sometimes they will behave badly if their daily routine changes.
- Does your family have many cats? Do the cats that live in your home have enough space?
- Has there been any change recently to cat litter boxes?

## 2. Deal with stress-related issues

### 2.1 Maintain a daily routine. 

A change in the home can stress the cat uneasy and lead to her claiming behavior. If your cat is this behavior, then a steady routine can help reduce stress and stop spraying.
- Feed your cat at the same time each day, and keep her litter box, litter box, and toys in place.
- If you have friends over at home, send the cat to another room. This is especially important if your client also has cats and the smell of cats gets into their clothes. This can stress your cat and lead to spraying.
- Several pheromone sprays, sold at most pet stores, are effective in soothing cats. If you know that there is a big change in your home, such as the arrival of a new member or pet, such an aerosol can be helpful in getting your cat to get acquainted.

### 2.2 Make sure the cats indoors have enough space. 

If you have a lot of cats, spraying is usually due to their territorial nature.
- Provide plenty of room for cats to rest in the air. Cats love to climb high to observe. You can also clean window sills, set aside space on a bookshelf, or buy cat box houses at a pet store.
- Have a variety of cat food, water, scratching posts, and toys available.
- Provide plenty of litter boxes for your cat. Although the cat's spraying behavior differs from normal urination, a lack of a litter box triggers their territorial mark-up response where spraying is an example. You should buy at least two boxes of sand and clean both boxes daily.

### 2.3 Eliminate your cat's urine. 

Repeated spraying is often caused by a cat's response to the smell in the cat's urine, especially in multiple cat homes. The pet's odor must be removed to prevent this from recurring.
- Wash anything that can be washed in a washing machine with regular soap. 
- Make a solution of 50% water and 50% white vinegar, and pour it into a spray bottle to sanitize where your cat has sprayed. This solution can deodorize and prevent your cat from continuing to pee in those places. 
- Pet stores and even supermarkets also sell detergents that contain synthetic pheromones and enzymes that help deodorize and stop cats from spraying.

### 2.4 Avoid exposing your cat to the outside world. 

Usually, a conflict with a neighbor's cat will lead to spraying. Even if your cat is not allowed outside, they can see or smell other cats through the window and initiate a response by spraying the urine.
- Move the furniture the cat normally rests on away from the window. Consider buying a treehouse for your cat to give her another place to rest. 
- Close windows, blinds, or doors. 
- Consider installing a motion sensor in your lawn sprinkler so the water will spray towards the cat as it gets closer to the window.

### 2.5 Help your cat adjust to new family members. 

A newborn baby appearing indoors may cause a cat to spray urine to ensure its territory is not compromised. You need to help your cat get through the transitions so it doesn't start doing the behavior.
- Keep up the routine, even if it's difficult. With your baby, the routines of your home change dramatically. Try to keep the routine of feeding, sleeping, and cleaning the litter box as much as possible.
- Before the baby is born, do not care much about the cat, as it will get used to it. This can be even more frustrating when the baby is in the house and it will react to be noticed.
- Introduce the cat to new toys and baby items by letting it smell and explore after opening. Anything that is new or has an unfamiliar smell can cause spraying in your cat. 

## 3. Seek medical intervention

### 3.1 Check with your veterinarian. 

Although spraying in cats is usually a behavioral problem, if home remedies aren't working, you may need to take your cat to the vet for a checkup. A wellness visit can rule out or identify and treat any medical problems that may be the cause of the behavior. Bladder control problems, especially in older cats, can be a sign of serious medical problems, such as organ failure.

### 3.2 Sterilize for cats. 

- If your cat has not been sterilized, your cat may be the cause of spraying his urine because he wants to show off to his partner. Spraying the urine is a sign of maturity in your cat's sex, and spaying may prevent this behavior.
- If possible, you should sterilize your cat before it is 6 months old. More than 90% of cats will not start spraying if they are sterilized within this time frame. 
- In older cats, about 87% will stop spraying after being spayed. Most sterilized cats will immediately stop this behavior, but still a small percentage below 10% will take several months.

### 3.3 Seek medical help. 

Spraying, even when caused by stress or anxiety, can be treated with certain medications prescribed by your veterinarian.
- You can buy oral antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications for your cat by taking your cat to the vet. These medications can ease the stress caused by a home with many cats or ease anxiety caused by a fluctuating lifestyle.
- Always consult your veterinarian and know your cat's medical history. Certain medical problems can interact badly with certain medications.
- All medicines have potential side effects. Check with your doctor about the side effects to look out for and their severity before giving your cat any medication.

> Advice
- Never scold the cat. Cats are not as responsive to positive or negative reinforcement as dogs, and scolding can add stress and increase the problem.
- If you have multiple cats, make sure they get the same attention. Cats are territorial just like humans, and they can get jealous when a cat is favored.
- Make sure your cat is spraying, not merely peeing. Peeing outside of the litter box can be a sign of a cat's health problem. You don't want to fail in handling when you confuse these two behaviors.
