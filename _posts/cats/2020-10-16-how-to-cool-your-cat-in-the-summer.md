title: "How to cool your cat in the summer?"
summary: Overheating can cause a cat to become dehydrated, heatstroke, and shock. Unlike humans, cats do not sweat and therefore have difficulty regulating their temperature as the summer gets hotter. Cats' primary methods of cooling off include avoiding sun exposure, being inactive, drinking plenty of water, and panting. These remedies are ineffective, and when cats are indoors or in a car with no outlet, their body temperature will increase, and become at risk of heatstroke. However, there are steps you can take to cool your cat during the hot summers to keep her healthy and happy.

However, there are steps you can take to cool your cat during the hot summers to keep her healthy and happy.

## 1. Create a cool environment for your cat

### 1.1 Turn on the air-conditioner. 

If you have air conditioning in your home, keep your cat indoors to let her enjoy the cool air. You can insulate your home from heat, such as keeping curtains, drapes, and doors closed. 
- Prepare a warm room so your cat can shelter if it feels cold. (Sometimes air conditioning and fans can chill cats and irritate them after a while.)
- Even if your cat likes to be outdoors, keep your cat indoors when the heat is at its peak, from 10 am to 4 pm.

### 1.2 Use fans to circulate air indoors. 

If you don't have air conditioning, you can use a fan and open windows to cool the house and reduce the heat of your cat. Place a fan in front of open windows to move air around the house to cool down. Make sure your pet is safe around the fan by checking that the cover is in place.
- Place one or two fans on the floor in a corner facing the center of the room. This allows the cat to lie at a comfortable distance to enjoy the air flowing through the coat. Moving your cat in the air can help cool the cat, like sweating.

### 1.3 Provide clean water regularly. 

Cats need to drink water to provide the necessary amount of water for the body. In addition, when the blood temperature is high, sensors in the brain will tell the cat to drink water to lower its temperature and dilute the blood. Therefore, you need to provide them with clean water regularly. 
- Prepare plenty of water bowls with large surfaces (such as dog dishes or bowls). Large bowls will encourage cats to drink because they don't like touching the mustache against the side of the bowl. You should change the water at least once a day and always fill the bowl with water.
- Do not give your cat water containing algae, as this plant is toxic and will cause diarrhea, vomiting, seizures, and sudden death
- Consider buying a cat drinking fountain. Many cats love to drink tap water and a tap is ideal for them.

### 1.4 Allow your cat to choose a cool place. 

Cats are agile creatures that find a cool place to shelter. They like to curl up in the bath or sink because the porcelain stays cool when it's hot outside. Because of the special nature of this material, cats often lie on the tile floors in the bathroom, laundry room, and kitchen. If your cat has an ideal place to avoid the heat, let her rest. 

## 2. Help your cat cool down

### 2.1 Let your cat lie in place on hot days. 

This time is not suitable for playing with cats. You should only let them play laser chase or play with rope in cool times. Instead, encourage your cat to rest and relax. The muscle activity that produces heat makes them feel more uncomfortable in this hot weather.

### 2.2 Make a shade for your cat. 

- If the cat is outdoors, make sure to shade it in order to minimize sunlight. Shade can be under trees, bushes, or umbrellas. If your cat is indoors, don't leave it in a room with plenty of sunlight and keep the area away from reflected sunlight.
- If your cat is outdoors, check the small houses and greenhouses outside before closing the doors. Indoor temperatures can get high and cats are at risk of death if locked inside.

### 2.4 Groom your cat every day. 

The ruffled coat prevents heat from escaping; You should groom your cat and allow the air to circulate to reduce the heat. This step is especially important for long-haired cats.
- Groom your cat at a cool time of day before his or her body temperature rises, such as in the early morning. Your cat will be comfortable with grooming when it is not upset by the high temperature.
- Do not shave your cat, as this will expose the skin to the sun, causing burns and cancer.
- Wearing a thick coat in the summer may seem a bit odd, but experts believe the coat insulates heat during hot days and has a warming effect in winter. So shaving your cat doesn't make it feel any cooler.
- However, if the coat is too thick or messy, it will create a barrier around the cat's body. This coating prevents the hair from working properly, so seek a professional to shave them.

### 2.5 Arrange a cool area. 

You can help cool your cat by keeping the nest in a cool, dark place to let her hide when she feels too hot. Simply place the cardboard box in a quiet and convenient place, such as in a closet, under a chair, or near a cool indoor location. Spread a layer of cotton or cool fabric on the bottom of the box. Put the ice pack in the sock and place it in the nest under the towel to keep the cat cool. 
- Another good way to do this is to lay a cloth or pad on your cat's preferred bed to prevent heat from escaping from the floor surface making her feel hot.
- Recognize and treat heatstroke

### 3.3 Contact your veterinarian for advice. 

You may need to see your vet for heatstroke treatment. Your veterinarian will administer an infusion into a vein to reduce the internal temperature and maintain a normal blood supply to the organs. Along with the increase in body temperature, the blood becomes thicker and reduces blood supply to vital organs. 
- Contact your veterinarian right away in case you suspect your cat is having a heatstroke.

> Advice
- Watch for fleas on your cat's body regularly during summer days as they multiply more in high temperatures, making the cat more uncomfortable than hot.

- When traveling long-distance by car (eg moving houses, etc.), you should turn on the air conditioner or open windows to allow ventilation while traveling, and do not cover the vents in the cat cage. gas circulates.
- Do not let your cat run outside in the middle of summer unattended.
- Always give your cat enough water to drink.
- Always keep your home cool. Below 25 degrees C is suitable.
