Depression syndrome is difficult to recognize because sometimes behavioral changes are not that different from normal. However, you can keep an eye on for signs of depression in your cat and take appropriate action.

## 1. Assess the situation

### 1.1 Take the cat to the vet. 

If you notice that your cat's behavior has changed, you should contact your veterinarian to make sure the cat doesn't have the problem that is causing the depression that requires special treatment.
- Talk to your veterinarian about any changes you notice in your cats, such as changes in eating habits, sleep patterns, and behavior. Your veterinarian will do regular physical exams, listen to your heart rate, check your eyes and ears, as well as take temperature measurements.
- Based on the behavioral changes you are providing, if your doctor deems it necessary, they will do blood tests, x-rays, or some other test. Some test results will be available immediately, but others take a few days to see results.
- If your cat has not found that your cat has any health problems, it may have depression.

### 1.2 Note any recent changes. 

Depression syndrome in cats is often related to a number of factors. You need to look at your current situation as well as look for any major recent changes to depression in your cat.
- Have you moved house lately? A change in accommodation is one of the main causes of depression in cats. Many cats have trouble converting homes and may experience temporary depression while adapting to a new environment. 
- Has anyone or pets been lost lately? Whether it's human or an animal, cats are affected by the loss. They do not understand death like humans, but still, realize that the absence of a person or an animal causes them to become depressed.
- Are you quite busy lately? Maybe it's because your new job, social relationship, or romantic relationship makes you spend less time with your cat. This is very easy to make them depressed. Cats in general, especially singers, are sociable and will experience depression if they feel left out.

### 1.3 Note the time of year. 

Seasonal depression (SAD) not only occurs in humans, but cats can be affected at certain times of the year, and they can become depressed during the winter months.
- Winter usually has short days with little sunlight. A lack of sunlight can cause depression in cats, causing them to change their behavior. If your cat has a change in behavior during a certain season, it is likely that he will suffer from seasonal depression.
- Sunlight has an impact on melatonin and serotonin levels. If they are deficient, humans, as well as cats, can feel tired, anxious, and depressed. Outdoor cats are particularly susceptible to winter depression because they spend all of their time in nature.

## 2. Know the Signs of Depression

### 2.1 Observe your cat's sleeping habits. 

Cats love to sleep. In fact, cats typically sleep for 16 hours a day. However, if they sleep more than usual, this could be a sign of depression.
- Cats often go to sleep, so it is difficult to recognize how long is too much. However, you should determine when they wake up and go to sleep. Use this base to observe your cat's sleeping habits. 
- If your cat always wakes up to greet you in the morning but suddenly sleeps in the kitchen cupboard, it may be depressed. Note also if your cat often wakes up from an activity, and is now sleeping in a chair. 
- Watch for signs of energy loss. Does the cat look dazed when the cat is awake? Some cats are naturally lazy by nature, but if you find that your cat is normally running and active but is now lying on the mattress all day, then he or she may suffer from depression.

### 2.2 Listen to your cat's calls with high frequency. 

Cats usually make a variety of sounds, from hissing to purrs or purrs. When they vocalize more than usual, this could be a sign of depression.
- Depressed cats often scream, clam, or fart in response to a stimulus or random sounds during the day. Maybe they're trying to tell us something is wrong.
- Each cat has a different amount of sleep, and how long is normal or not is up to your consideration. If your cat often makes a loud noise to announce her presence or want attention, don't worry about it making frequent sounds. However, if your cat is normally calm but wakes you up during the night with a scream, she may be expressing her unhappy mood.
- A cat too much noise may be caused by the death of a close friend. The cat screams to try to help the friend find them.

### 2.3 Observe your cat's eating habits. 

Depressed cats may eat more or less to fight sadness. Be mindful of the amount of food your cat eats.
- Anorexia is one of the consequences of depression in humans and animals. Your cat may not have a craving for it and you will find that when it is time to eat, it refuses to eat and does not touch wet or dry food that is available. When eating habits change, cats can lose weight.
- In contrast, some children eat a lot when depressed. While such a situation is quite rare, it is still possible. If you notice your cat is demanding to eat a lot, especially gaining weight, this is also a sign of depression.

### 2.4 Check your cat's fur. 

When depressed, cats lose the habit of grooming themselves or excessive licking. This phenomenon can be clearly seen.
- If the cat's coat is dull and sticky, the cat may not be licking the fur on her own. In addition, you may also find that they are rarely groomed. For example, when cats tend to clean themselves in the middle of the living room after dinner, but suddenly give up the habit, this could be a sign of depression.
- Others lick excess hair to curb anxiety caused by depression. You will find them grooming themselves for a long time. In addition, some areas will experience baldness or an itchy rash from licking too much.

### 2.5 Notice how often your cat is hiding. 

Cats are sociable animals, but want to be alone when they are. They often prefer to hide in a fixed location, such as a closet or closet, but hiding for a long time can be a sign of depression.
- When depressed, your cat will hide in places that are difficult to find. Instead of crawling under cabinets, they can dig and hide in a corner of the room to stay undetected. 
- As mentioned above, only you can determine what is normal for a cat. Some dogs like to hide more than others, but if the cat stays in the living room all afternoon and suddenly disappears today, they may have depression.

### 2.6 Observe the cleaning tray. 

This is an item that may show signs of stress, a symptom of depression in cats.
- Understand the difference between marking and using urine. Urine marking is a form of territorial marking and is usually not a symptom of depression in cats. Urine usually appears on vertical cylindrical objects with a pungent odor and is usually from male cats. If a cat is using urine to mark its territory, it may be because it feels its territory has been violated and not caused by depression. However, the pressure between a cat and another pet can cause anxiety, stress, and depression. You should settle all territorial disputes before a mental health problem can arise.
- If you notice any scattered urine or feces around the house, this could be a sign of depression in your cat. They mess around with the toilet tray probably due to their dislike of size, shape, type of sand, and dirty tray. If the litter box is clean, and you haven't changed the tray recently, urination may be linked to depression.

## 3. Overcoming Depression

### 3.1 Take proper care of your cat. Depression that develops in cats can be due to inadequate care. You need to accommodate your cat's loving needs so that he will always be happy and secure.

Cats are sociable animals but are highly independent. They will usually signal when they need attention, and you should allow them to come closer. If your cat approaches you and displays welcoming behavior, such as rubbing your legs or sniffing your body, it is craving your attention. You may not be able to meet your cat's needs all the time, but at least pamper them so they know how much you love them.
- Cats often want mental stimulation, so spend 15 to 20 minutes a day playing with them. Cats love to play with stringed toys and chase animals with velvet toys. However, you should avoid rough games with cats. Some people pull their whole body down with their hands, but this can cause the cat to become timid and aggressive.

### 3.2 Find other forms of entertainment for your cat when you're away from home. 

If your work has been busy lately and your cat has been depressed by this, prepare to entertain him or her when you're away from home. There are many ways to bring joy to your cat while you are out and about.
- Keep window blinds open during the day, especially if you live in a suburban area. Make sure to set up a table, cupboard, or pole so the cat can climb onto the window. They enjoy the outdoors and are exposed to light and play while you're away from home. 
- Some companies sell DVDs and other electronic entertainment content to fit in your television while you are out and about. Some movies have cat stimulant effects such as movies about birds, mice, and other cats. However, you should be careful and the cat may jump on top and spill the TV. You need to secure the television in case the cat likes to explore.
- There are a variety of toys designed for your cat to play while you are away, such as mint leaves and mouse toys. There are also a number of smart puzzle games that include toys or pieces of food placed inside a device. Cats have to find a way to open the device for a reward and will attract their attention when you go out. Be cautious, however, as some toys warn against letting your cat play alone. You should choose toys that are safe for them when playing by yourself.

### 3.3 Use light therapy.

If your cat has seasonal depression, use light therapy to relieve winter depression.
- Buy a bulb that excites UV rays and turns it on for a few hours a day with your cat in the house. These bulbs are available in greenhouses, as they are often bought to grow plants indoors.
- Sol Box is a brand of UV light that is recommended by veterinarians because they are designed specifically for cats. You can buy it at the online retailer Pawsitive Lighting. These emit white light, and the manufacturer recommends exposing your cat for 30 minutes a day during the winter months.

### 3.4 Try synthetic pheromones. Your veterinarian may suggest a number of synthetic pheromones that can stimulate relaxation and excitement in cats.

### 3.5 Consider medication. 

This is the last resort for cat depression due to some of the side effects and problems with medication administration.
- There are four drugs used to treat depression and several other behavioral problems in cats: benzodiazepine (BZ), monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), and relapse inhibitor. selective serotonin absorption (SSRI). Usually, when a cat is depressed, your veterinarian will prescribe an SSRI or MAOI. 
- Each drug has different side effects. Some have quite serious effects. For example, an MAOI can cause a life-threatening reaction if a cat accidentally ingests cheese while on medication. It is important to understand all the possible side effects before giving them any medication. Consult with your veterinarian about side effects and those that require immediate medical treatment.
- Cats have a characteristic dislike of medications. Most veterinarians will only prescribe medication if other measures have not worked. If your doctor prescribes it, you need to know the procedure, dosage, and storage. If you are confused or concerned about anything, you should contact your veterinarian for more information.

> Advice

Don't rush to conclude that your cat is depressed because a number of symptoms, especially anorexia, are often linked to many other illnesses. If your cat has a serious health problem, you should intervene as soon as possible.
- If you feel that your cat is lonely because your other pet is gone, consider getting a cat or dog. Of course, this is not an easy decision, but some are more sociable than others. If your cat likes to make new friends, consider having a pet.
