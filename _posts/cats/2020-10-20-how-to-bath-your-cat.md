> Even though cats are very clean and groomed, sometimes they need a bath - maybe they get dirty, or their fur is oily and needs to be cleaned, or they are being treated for something so they need to. must bathe daily with medicine. Bathing your cat without stressing it can be difficult, but not impossible if you follow these guidelines.

## 1. Prepare Before Bathing

### 1.1 Trim your cat's claws.

Your cat can become frightened when it is immersed in the water, so to minimize injury, it's a good idea to trim your cat's nails before bathing. Trim your cat's claws a few hours or days before bathing, so she can calm down in the shower. Take care to cut the cat so that the cat doesn't hurt or bleed.
- Rewarding your cat with treats after the claw has been cut will make the cat feel better.

### 1.2 Groom your cat.

Don't skip this step. Brushing will help remove tangled hair. If the coat is already wet, removing the tangle will hurt your cat. If your cat likes to be groomed, you can do so in the bath to make the cat more comfortable.
- You can sometimes brush your cat to distract you from the claw. This is two targets for an arrow, but you need someone else's help.

### 1.3 Buy the right soap for your cat.

You can buy them at vet clinics or pet stores. Check the user guide to make sure it is suitable for your cat. Mix soap in water if needed. Using human shampoo can not only dry out the cat's skin, but it is also toxic to cats. You also shouldn't use dog soap instead. If you can't find the right soap, use plain water. 
- You can use a towel to soap your cat's fur, but it's better to use your hands.

### 1.4 Make your cat feel like a bath.

First, you need to tire your cat from playing, and at a time when your cat wants to relax most, take the cat to bathe. This will make the cat less likely to bite, scratch, or try to escape. Choose when the cat is most relaxed - usually after eating. If the cat is still playful, play with it until it is tired. Here are some ways to tempt your cat to bathe:
- Place your cat's toy in a tub that is not filled with water. Put your cat in the tub and play with the toy for a few minutes. Then stop, pour a little more water before letting the cat play again. This way, you can help your cat get used to the tub. Bathing will quickly become a pleasant and not intimidating experience for a cat.
- You can use a special bath toy, like a mouse tied to a rope or something floating. Show your cat the toy in the tub only and it will make her more interested in bathing.

## 2. Prepare the Bathroom

![Bathe-a-Cat-Step-5]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bath-your-cat/v4-728px-Bathe-a-Cat-Step-5-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Close the bathroom door.

This will prevent the cat from escaping, and if you have multiple cats it will keep other cats out as well. A cat squealing may frighten or scratch your cat in the bath. Close the door to keep the cat from running out and crashing things in a panic.
- If your cat has never been in the bathroom, let him get used to space first. If the bathroom has a toilet, put the lid down. Your cat may accidentally jump into the toilet bowl and become panicked.
- Likewise, if you leave your cat's litter box in the bathroom, remove it. If the cat runs out of the bath, it will jump straight into the litter box and create a mess.

### 2.2 Make the bath safe.

Place a rubber mat or towel in the tub so the cat won't slip and feel more stable. You will also have to put some towels on the floor as the floor will get wet. Also, make sure you have at least two extra towels to dry your cat after bathing.
- You can place the grill in the tub to give your cat a place to cling. This will reduce the chance of your cat scratching you, and the cat will also feel more secure.

![Bathe-a-Cat-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bath-your-cat/v4-728px-Bathe-a-Cat-Step-7-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Prepare a bath.

Fill the tub with lukewarm water (not hot water) before bringing the cat in, as some cats are scared of the sound of running water. Fill two large glasses of water with water, or ideally two watering cans so that you can control the flow of water while bathing your cat. This way, you won't have to run for water multiple times and scare your cat.
- Do not use showerheads or use running water directly on the cat. The water can come out too hard and scare your cat. The water should flow as gently and smoothly as possible instead of running like a tornado.
- You won't have time to run out to get things while bathing your cat, so be prepared for everything. Always be ready and calm.

### 2.4 Wear the right clothes.

This will help you avoid scratches. A long-sleeved shirt, sweater or long-sleeved shirt can all protect you from scratching your cat's skin. You can also wear rubber-necked gloves, but it's quite entangling. Be careful and gentle when washing your cat's hair and rubbing her stomach, as these are very sensitive places.
- It is best to wear old clothes and let them get wet comfortably.

## 3. Bathing for Cats

![Bathe-a-Cat-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bath-your-cat/v4-728px-Bathe-a-Cat-Step-9-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Always in control of your cat.

Talk to your cat in a gentle bath tone. Sometimes, the cat will try to climb out of the tub. If they just like to dip one or two feet in the tub, you can let them turn their back on the tub and stand on both feet. You may need to gently grab the skin on the nape of the cat's nape to keep the cat in the tub. If you are unable to do so, you can buy a cat's belt, as long as the cat is not in pain.
- Bathing your cat is easier with two people working together, especially if your cat is strong enough to get out of hand. One person can grab the nape of the cat's name, and the other person can bathe the cat. You have to do it quickly, but don't rush. When holding the cat, make sure the cat can still breathe.

![Bathe-a-Cat-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bath-your-cat/v4-728px-Bathe-a-Cat-Step-10-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Don't grapple with cats.

You absolutely should not make a comfortable decision to get your cat to bathe. A cat weighing 5 kg can injure you. You just need to wet the cat's feet. Try it again another day and gradually find ways to bathe the cat.
- If you are anxious or overly excited about this, the cat will notice it and become anxious.

![Bathe-a-Cat-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bath-your-cat/v4-728px-Bathe-a-Cat-Step-11-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Dip the cat down so the water reaches the neck.

Use a little soap and water to clean the cat's neck, body, legs, abdomen, and tail. Scratch from neck to tail down the hair. Scratch like a massage so that the cat feels reassured and unafraid. It is okay to do this as you petting and brushing your cat to make it feel like a bath.

![Bathe-a-Cat-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bath-your-cat/v4-728px-Bathe-a-Cat-Step-12-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Keep the soap out of your cat's eyes, nose, mouth, and ears.

To prevent water from getting into your cat's ears, put a cotton ball in it - the kind used for wounds. Don't forget to remove the cotton ball after bathing. Cotton can also reduce noise and make bathing your cat easier.
- If you are going to bathe to kill lice, wet the neck first. The lice will run into drier areas, so if you immerse the cat's body in the water, the lice will pop up on the cat's head and face. When the neck is wet, the lice will not be able to run to the cat's head and become contaminated with lice-killing soap.

![Bathe-a-Cat-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bath-your-cat/v4-728px-Bathe-a-Cat-Step-13-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Rinse off the soap from the cat's body.

Use the water in the tub to flush all of the soap on your cat. Then, drain the tub and rinse the cat's body twice with either bucket or warm tap water. You must rinse off the soap on the sides of the tub. Continue rinsing the cat until the water is clear and there are no more soap bubbles.
- Mixing soap in the water before you start bathing will help you avoid using too much soap and having to rinse too much.
- If your cat has long, thick fur, this will take longer.

![Bathe-a-Cat-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bath-your-cat/v4-728px-Bathe-a-Cat-Step-14-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 3.6 Wash your cat's face with water and a towel. You don't need to use soap at this step, as the soap will get in your cat's eyes. Use a wet washcloth and gently wipe the cat's face from the nose out in the direction of the hair growth until it is clean

You can do this later and stop when you are done bathing your cat.
- Do not put the cat's face in the water. The cat will panic.

![Bathe-a-Cat-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bath-your-cat/v4-728px-Bathe-a-Cat-Step-15-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 3.7 Watch for signs of fear or stress in your cat.

These symptoms include: wheezing, screaming, strong breathing, sneezing, and crying hard. Pay attention to your cat while bathing. If the cat is too scared of what you do, stop. Don't try to continue, otherwise, you will be injured or your cat will be severely depressed.
- Be gentle with the cat in the first shower. Don't do anything that scares the cat so much that it doesn't want to bathe next time. Be patient and if necessary, do it again later.

![Bathe-a-Cat-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bath-your-cat/v4-728px-Bathe-a-Cat-Step-16-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 3.8 If your cat is opposed to bathing, use a wet towel.

It will remove dust from the cat's body and make the cat cleaner. You can find wet towels at pet stores to groom your cat. The smell of this product is also very pleasant.

## 4. Wipe or Dry Cats

![Bathe-a-Cat-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bath-your-cat/v4-728px-Bathe-a-Cat-Step-17-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Absorb water on the cat's fur.

Get a dry towel and try to absorb the water from the cat's fur. Then wrap the cat in a towel and rub it gently. When the towel gets too wet, use another dry towel. Wipe until the fur is slightly damp.
- When absorbing, gently massage your hands as if in a massage. You can pre-warm the towels with a hairdryer to make the cat more comfortable.
- You still have to spoil your cat. If your cat won't let you dry, stop.

![Bathe-a-Cat-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bath-your-cat/v4-728px-Bathe-a-Cat-Step-18-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.2 Finish the process of drying the cat's fur.

Short-haired cats can let their hair dry in the bathroom as long as drafts are avoided. Your cat will enjoy being warmed (a heater or blower) and sit on a dry towel. For long-haired cats, you will need to use a comb and more towels. Long hair is easier to brush when wet, so you can brush it until the coat is dry.
- If your cat is not afraid of a dryer, use a warm dryer to dry her hair from a certain distance. Don't turn it on too hot, as it can burn and be frightened.
- You can gently brush your cat to avoid tangling, especially if your cat has a long coat.

![Bathe-a-Cat-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bath-your-cat/v4-728px-Bathe-a-Cat-Step-19-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 4.3 Reward your cat.

This is a must. If you want your cat to enjoy bathing, you should reward your cat after bathing. Give your cat the treat she likes, feline grass, or other foods. You can also feed the cat food that you only use on special occasions. If your cat associates bathing with good food, your cat will soon love bathing. </ref>
- Compliment your cat by petting him, saying he was very docile, and cuddling it after bathing. Cats often feel fearful and sensitive after bathing, so your attention will make a good impression.

## 5. Another way to bathe the cat

![Bathe-a-Cat-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bath-your-cat/v4-728px-Bathe-a-Cat-Step-20-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 5.1 Bathe your cat with a bucket of water.

You can create two baths for your cat with two buckets of water. Fill the bucket with warm water halfway. Dip the cat in the bucket and use a towel, making sure the cat is completely wet. Then, rub the soap on the cat's fur. Dip the cat in the remaining bucket of water to rinse the soap off.
- You may need another bucket of rinse water to rinse the soap off your cat.
- You can do this outdoors in warm, sunny weather. You will need two people to avoid the cat escaping. You should not use this method on cats that are entirely indoors and are not used to going outdoors.

![Bathe-a-Cat-Step-21]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bath-your-cat/v4-728px-Bathe-a-Cat-Step-21-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 5.2 Bathe your cat with a bath or shower.

Make sure your cat has room to hold on to, like a small towel or bath mat. This area should have doors - instead of curtains - so that the cat cannot run away. The shower should be sprayed far enough away to wet the cat, soap, spray water to rinse the cat, and then wipe or dry. Use warm water and a gentle spray to keep your cat from feeling scared.
- There are cats who love to take a shower, but others are afraid of the sound of running water. This can hurt you or your cat.
- You can purchase additional plastic hose connections for the bathroom sink that are long enough to reach the shower floor. Or you can purchase a manual hose and a Y-connector to connect to your showerhead.

![Bathe-a-Cat-Step-22]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bath-your-cat/v4-728px-Bathe-a-Cat-Step-22-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 5.3 Bathe the kitten in the sink or small tub

Kittens feel more secure in a small space, making it easier to control the cat. If you have a kitten or an overly scared cat, you can bathe the cat in the washbasin or a small tub in your bathtub. Just put a basin leaning against an adult's tub. You can fill a plastic tub with water, soap your cat, and do the same steps as usual. If you are using a sink, make sure it has no drainage holes, as even if it is closed, the cat's paws may slip in and get hurt.
- This method works well for adult cats who prefer in confined spaces.
- Place a cotton towel on the bottom of the tub so that the cat feels reassured that there is room to hang on. You can also gently press on the back of the cat and speak gently to help relieve the cat.

![Bathe-a-Cat-Step-23]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-bath-your-cat/v4-728px-Bathe-a-Cat-Step-23-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 5.4 Dry your cat.

If your cat's fur is oily, you can use cornstarch instead of bathing with water. Sprinkle cornstarch over the cat, then gently stroke to rub the cornstarch all over the cat. Leave for about 20 minutes and then brush off.
- This method is less stressful than water, but should not be used to wash off any toxins that your cat accidentally gets caught in the fur.

> Advice
- The earlier you bathe your cat, the easier it will be. As your cat gets older, he or she will get used to bathing and struggling less.
- If none of the methods work, take your cat to a reputable pet care site or veterinarian. They have the experience and tools necessary to keep cats calm and safe. There are cats that require sedation if the doctor sees it right.
- If you have time, start with a very shallow (about 1 cm) warm water level. Pet the cat and feed it if it likes to eat. Continue with this level of water until the cat is no longer afraid. Repeat daily or every few days until the cat gets used to the schedule. Gradually raise the water level until the cat will stand at 5cm. Finally, have someone else hold the cat so that you can create waves in the tub. This can take weeks, or months, depending on the cat. But it's well worth the effort to know that you can bathe your cat in times of need.

> Warning
- If you don't know how to grab the nape of the cat, don't try. Your cat will be able to suffocate.
- Do not bathe your cat more than once every 2 weeks. Bathing too much can wash away any of the oil on your cat's fur, causing it to become frayed, and reducing its natural ability to resist a number of factors.
- Cats are too small, too old, or too thin to regulate their own body temperature. Dry or completely dry your cat and keep her warm to avoid hypothermia.
- The ambient temperature should always be 20 ° C with low humidity. Keep the cat indoors and warm enough for 12 hours after bathing if the weather is not right.
