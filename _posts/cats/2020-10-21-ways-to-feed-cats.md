## 1. Choosing Cat Food

### 1.1 Know your cat's basic nutritional needs. 

Average-sized adult cats need 250 calories per day with a balanced diet of protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. Your cat's specific caloric needs will depend on her size, weight, and activity level.
- Cats are "obligatory predators." They need to absorb animal fats and proteins to get enough nutrients. Make sure the cat food meets your cat's nutritional needs.
- Water should not be ignored. Water is an extremely important part of your cat's diet, and cats that eat dry foods need to drink more because they don't get enough water from food. Wash your cat's bowl and change the water often. You can also have a fountain or drip dispenser to increase your water intake by entertaining your cat.

### 1.2 Consider using canned or dry food. 

Both types are beneficial for cats. In many cases, your cat can eat dry food and stay hydrated. If you are concerned about your cat's needs, you can consult with your veterinarian to choose the right food for your cat.
- If your cat has urinary tract disease, diabetes, or kidney problems, the amount of water in canned foods can help them absorb enough water. Canned cat food contains up to 78% water.
- Dried foods are often more nutritious because they contain less water.
- The protein and carbohydrate content of wet and dry foods are often varied according to the type of recipe. Dry food usually contains more calories because it does not have as high moisture as wet food.

### 1.3 Consider feeding your cat both canned and dry foods. 

Combining dry and moist foods will help your cat get enough water instead of just dry food. Picky eater cats also enjoy a varied diet.
- If you decide to feed your cat a variety of foods, be careful not to overfeed. Also, make sure the foods you include in your meal contain the right amount of calories and nutrients.

### 1.4 Buy high-quality food. 

Just like human food, high-quality cat food is often well balanced with protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. You should choose one that contains protein and animal fats. Cats need nutrients from animal meat to get all the necessary nutrients such as taurine and unsaturated fatty acids that are not found in vegetarian foods. 
- Look for the AAFCO (American Food Control Officials Association) statement on the cat's food packaging. This organization ensures that the foods will meet your cat's nutritional needs.
- Avoid foods that contain artificial colors and flavors or harmful chemicals.

### 1.5 Research and analysis of food labels. 

Knowing what is in your cat's food is not easy. It's important to look for some things to do when buying cat food: 
- If the product name uses a word like "tuna" or "chicken" before the phrase "cat food" it means the product contains at least 95% of this ingredient. For example, "Chicken Food" should contain 95% chicken.
- The word “with” in the product name means that the food contains about 3% of the ingredients. “Chicken Food with Ingredients” may contain only 3% chicken, while “Chicken Food” may contain at least 95% chicken.
- Cat food that contains a phrase such as “dinner” or “snack” contains less than 95% meat but more than 25% is meat ingredients. Often these products use grain or other protein sources, as a byproduct, to add to the main ingredients of the food.
- There is a difference between the words "meat," "meat by-products," and "flour." "Meat" refers to the "meat" (muscle and fat) of the animal and is generally considered to be a source of top-quality protein. "Meat by-products" are clean, meat-free parts such as organs, bones, brains, and blood. These ingredients are not harmful to cats (remember that many people still eat offal!), But they have a lower quality protein content than meat. The “flour” is the hard tissue or bone and is generally considered the lowest-quality protein source.

### 1.6 Consider giving your cat home-cooked food. 

Nowadays, many cat breeders enjoy preparing cat food at home. Home-cooked foods provide the fresh, nutritious ingredients that contain no additives or preservatives found in most industrial cat foods. However, preparing cat food usually takes a lot of time and money, and requires careful preparation to avoid infection
- If you do decide to feed your cat home-cooked food, carefully choose recipes from reputable sources. Furthermore, you must verify that recipes provide nutritional information including calorie count and the ratio of calcium to phosphorus.
- Consider buying a meat grinder and / or food processor to make it easier to prepare cat food.
- Keep in mind that cats need to eat meat, but they also need to eat a variety of foods other than meat to maintain a healthy diet. Carbohydrates, such as rice or corn, can be absorbed in small amounts. Food ingredients should also contain fatty acids, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals.

## 2. Consider Your Cat's Special Dietary Needs

![Feed-Cats-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-feed-cats/v4-728px-Feed-Cats-Step-7-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Determine if your cat is obese. 1 out of every 5 cats is obese.

Being overweight can lead to health problems such as diabetes, joint disease, and some blood circulation problems in cats. You can tell if your cat needs to lose weight by touching its belly. If you can't feel the ribs on the top and side of the belly, your cat is likely obese. 
- Your veterinarian can also assist you in determining your cat's normal weight range.

![Feed-Cats-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-feed-cats/v4-728px-Feed-Cats-Step-8-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Determine the percentage of body fat. 

Cat specific calorie absorption requirements may differ from those printed on cat food packaging. The best way to determine if your cat is gaining or losing weight is to check the fat percentage. This test assesses the cat's body shape and determines the amount of fat covering the bones.
- Most fat percentage tests use a 0-5 or 0-10 rating. 0 represents malnutrition (underweight, starving cats) and 5-10 indicates overweight. The ideal pet's weight is between 3 for the 0-5 scale and 5 on the 0-10 scale.
- You should feel the ribs when you place your fingers on the cat's belly and chest, but the fingers shouldn't get stuck between the bones. If the ribs are clearly raised, it is a sign that your cat is underweight. If you can't touch the ribs or cover fat, this is a sign that the cat is overweight.
- When looking at the cat's body from the side and front, you should be able to see the cat's waste. If the cat is oval in shape and lacks a sharp waist, then the cat is obese. When the circumference is reduced (like a hound), the cat is losing weight.
- The cat's belly should not swoop downwards; This is a sign that the cat's belly is too fat.

![Feed-Cats-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-feed-cats/v4-728px-Feed-Cats-Step-9-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Adjust feeding according to your cat's needs. 

If the cat is overweight (or underweight), decrease the amount or increase the amount of food by 10%. Then, check your cat's fat percentage for two weeks. Make adjustments to the changes in your cat's body shape.
- Don't overadjust your cat's diet. Cats have an abnormal metabolism and a severe caloric deficit can negatively affect the liver.

![Feed-Cats-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-feed-cats/v4-728px-Feed-Cats-Step-10-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 Feed your cat on a prescribed weight control regimen. 

The regimen is regulated by many veterinarians and can provide your cat with proper nutrition while encouraging weight loss. There are many different types of prescribed diets, so you should consult with your veterinarian to determine which is right for your cat.
- A high-fiber, low-calorie diet high in fiber will help your cat feel full. They will slowly lose weight over a few months. Some examples include Purina OM (Obesity Control) and Hills RD.
- The dietary protein content of high protein, low carbohydrate to appropriate the natural digestion of cats. Giving your cat a high intake of animal protein can help them lose weight. Hills MD is an example.
- The metabolic diet is developed to stimulate the cat's metabolism. The only food available for cats in this mode is Hills Metabolic Diet (for cats).

### 2.5 Consider the "Life Stage" diet. 

Your cat's dietary needs will vary depending on their age, and you should feed your cat what it needs at each stage. In general, there are three stages to watch out for when using your cat's diet: kittens, adult cats, and older cats.
- Kittens lie in the post-weaning period until 12 months of age. Kittens need more protein and calories because they're still growing. Kitten foods also have a distinct mineral balance to support your growing cat's nutritional needs. 
- Adult cats are 1-7 years old. Adult cat food has an effective balance of nutrients to help maintain a normal weight.
- Older cats are cats 8 years of age or older. Older cats often experience health problems or lack of flexibility. They need nutrients like glucose and fatty acids. These foods are often low in protein, which can cause kidney deformation in older cats. 
- There are also a number of “lifestyle” diets available for sterilized or domestic cats. These foods are typically lower in calories than regular cat food, but that's the only key difference.

![Feed-Cats-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-feed-cats/v4-728px-Feed-Cats-Step-12-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 2.6 Consult with your doctor about any prescription diet for your medical condition. 

If your cat has health problems, such as diabetes, urinary problems, joints, or kidneys, talk to your vet about the best foods for your cat. Each type of disease has its own diet, although experts do not always agree on their effectiveness.
- Diabetic cat food often removes humectants and certain carbohydrates to control and stabilize your cat's blood sugar. In addition, a cat with diabetes needs insulin treatment. Consult with your doctor about your cat's needs.
- Cats with a weak stomach or ulcerative bowel disease may eat a limited ingredient or prescribed diets, such as Hills i / d, Purina EN, or Royal Canin Veterinary Diet Gastrointestinal.
- Cats with urinary problems often should eat a diet that controls minerals that can store them in the cat's body. Purina UR, Hills CD, Hills XD, and Royal Canin Veterinary Diet Urinary SO are some good examples of this type of diet.

## 3. Establish Feeding Habits

![Feed-Cats-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-feed-cats/v4-728px-Feed-Cats-Step-13-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Determination of fixed feeding time. 

When choosing your cat's food, set a regular and consistent feeding time. A regular feeding routine keeps your cat happy and comfortable.
- Disrupting a cat's feeding schedule can be stressful and lead to digestive and other health problems in your cat.

![Feed-Cats-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-feed-cats/v4-728px-Feed-Cats-Step-14-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Control your food intake. 

Every time you feed, you should measure the right amount of food to grasp your cat's eating habits and quickly detect any changes that arise. 
- There is often no specific criteria for how much to feed your cat because of differences in size, age, activity level, and weight. But typically a cat weighing about 4 kg needs to absorb 250 calories per day to maintain proper nutrition. 250 calories equal 4/5 of a cup of dry food or less than 180 ml of wet food.
- Follow the feeding instructions on the feed package or the manufacturer's website as a starting point. Then adjust the amount of food based on your cat's weight and response.

![Feed-Cats-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-feed-cats/v4-728px-Feed-Cats-Step-15-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Get some cat food ready. 

While a regular feeding schedule is in the best interests of most cats, having a pre-prepared food plan works for others. Leaving the food on hand allows your cat to eat when she feels hungry and has a snack in the same way as a natural behavior. Also, this is useful if the schedule does not allow multiple meals during the day. Nursing cats are often fed ad libitum because their nutritional needs are greater than others. 
- The potential downside to free-feeding is that you cannot closely monitor changes in eating behavior and some cats will overeat when given comfortable access. You should always keep an eye on your cat's weight and adjust if necessary.

![Feed-Cats-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-feed-cats/v4-728px-Feed-Cats-Step-16-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Provide separate food and water for each cat. 

Cats have a tendency to be possessive, especially if they are confused about which bowl is theirs.
- Small stainless steel bowls are durable and easy to clean, so you should choose this one.
- You should wash the dishes after each feeding and always have clean water available for your cat.

![Feed-Cats-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-feed-cats/v4-728px-Feed-Cats-Step-17-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Consider your cat's age. 

As cats get older and older, their nutritional needs will change. In addition to following a life stage diet, you should feed them differently depending on age.
- Kittens should get all of their nutrition from their mother's milk during the first 4 to 6 weeks of birth. When you are ready to wean, give your cat special food. Feed them 5-6 times a day as the kittens need to eat often and not eat too much during the day.
- Adult cats should be fed twice a day. Use the prescribed portion sizes and adjust the amount of food the cat gets older and less active. 
- Older cats only need to eat once a day. Follow your veterinarian's advice for specific nutritional needs for your cat.

![Feed-Cats-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-feed-cats/v4-728px-Feed-Cats-Step-18-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.6 Avoid giving your cat too many treats. You can feed your cat treats or canned salmon or tuna, but only in moderation. Treats should not total more than 5% of your cat's food intake.

Feeding your cat too many treats will cause him to be obese and have digestive problems.
- Eating too many junk foods also means that your cat less likely to eat food often leads to nutritional imbalances.
- It is okay to feed your cat tuna from time to time, but this fish does not provide the nutrients they need, so you should not replace your normal food completely. 

![Feed-Cats-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-feed-cats/v4-728px-Feed-Cats-Step-19-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.7 Avoid dangerous foods. 

There are some foods that are harmful to your cat's health. Some foods to avoid include: 
- Raw milk and dairy products: Cats are lactose intolerant, and milk (other than mother's milk) can cause diarrhea and digestive problems. Tremorgenic mycotoxins are likely to form from expired dairy products and are especially dangerous for cats.
- Grapes and raisins: Although the cause is unknown, these two are not good for both cats and dogs. These foods can damage the kidneys and induce vomiting in the cat.
- Raw bread dough. Powdered with live yeast can be dangerous for cats and can affect the stomach.
- Chocolate: Although cats generally don't like to eat these foods, you should still keep them out of reach.
- Onion/garlic/chives/scallions: These and similar groups of plants can cause anemia and serious red blood cell problems. 

> Advice
- The FDA does not regulate the use of words such as "high quality" for pet food. “High quality” pet food does not necessarily have better ingredients or nutrients than regular food. You should always check the nutrition on the packaging to see what you are feeding your cat.
- You should always be aware that environmental factors such as the number of animals, temperature, and climate can all affect your cat's eating habits. If their eating habits change, it is not necessarily a sign of a serious problem. You need to monitor your cat's eating habits, activity level, coat shine, and clarity of the eyes to determine if he has a major problem. But if the cat doesn't eat or drink for 24 hours, then you should take it to the vet immediately.

> Warning
- Do not give your cat milk instead of water. Milk is not essential in a cat's diet, and some cats cannot digest the lactose in cow's milk.
- Do not give your cat any foods that are not intended for them. Cats' metabolism is very different from humans or even dogs, and they should only eat cat food to prevent some serious nutritional problems and illnesses.
