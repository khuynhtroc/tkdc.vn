> Is your cat refusing to go to the bathroom in the sandbox anymore? Understanding why your cat is not using the litter box is key to correcting her behavior. An underlying cause is often stress, such as changes that happen in the home. Health problems are another common culprit if your cat suddenly stops using the litter box, especially an older cat.

## 1. Retraining after moving houses, changing sand, or after a negative event

### 1.1 Move the sandbox to the correct position. 

A cat may stop defecating in the litter box after having gone through an event that scares him, such as making a loud noise or being disturbed by another animal. They may hate the placement of the sandbox when you move or move. Keep the sandbox in a quiet place with less traffic and the cat can see people approaching. Choose a room with at least two exits so the cat won't feel surrounded.
- Keep the sandbox away from the food and drink bowls. Cats do not like eating, drinking, and going to the toilet in the same place.
- Signs that your cat is uncomfortable with the litter box are rushing in and out of the litter box or going to the toilet near the litter box. Try moving the sandbox into another room if you notice this.
- Place at least one sandbox on each floor if your house has multiple floors.

### 1.2 Play with the cat near the sandbox. 

Try playing with the cat in the sandbox area. Leave a toy (not food) in the room where your cat plays and create a positive connection with the sandbox. 
- You can pick the cat up close to the sandbox to let it probe, but don't put the cat in the box or reward it for using it. Such tactics can be counterproductive because they make the cat uncomfortable or frightened. Unlike dogs, cats often choose the sandbox themselves, especially when they have used it in the past.

### 1.3 Keep the sandbox clean. 

If the cat sits on the edge of the sandbox or defecates next to it, it may find it too dirty. Clean up any lumps and cover with fresh sand at least once a day, twice as much as possible. Wash the sandbox once a week with baking soda or unscented soap. 
- If you use a lump-free type of sand, replace all the sand in the container every two days to prevent the build-up of odors that keep your cat away.
- Do not wash the sandbox with scented products. Do not use an antiseptic unless it is specifically intended for cleaning cat litter, as many disinfectants contain chemicals that are toxic to cats.

### 1.4 Gradually change to a new type of sand. 

If you buy a new type of sand, you will need to let your cat get used to it slowly. Mix a little new sand with the old sand and gradually increase the proportion of new sand with each sand change. Cats are generally tolerant of odorless sand and have a texture similar to that of old sand.
- If you can't buy old sand, get two or three new types of sand. Pour each sand into a separate box next to each other and let the cat choose its favorite sandbox.
- Try adjusting the depth of the sand, especially if the new sand has a different texture from the type of sand your cat is used to. Many cats like less than 5 cm of sand. Long-haired cats often prefer thin layers of sand that they can dig into the bottom of the box.

### 1.5 Repair problems when using a new sandbox. 

If your cat doesn't respond well to changing the litter box, try the following adjustments to make the litter box more appealing to the cat: 
- Some cats like covered sandboxes, others like open sandboxes. Try attaching or removing the sandbox roof.
- Remove the plastic liner in the sandbox. Cats can be smoky because their nails get caught in the lining.
- Most cats will adapt well to a self-cleaning sandbox, but not all cats will. There are cats who are worried about the sound of motors running and refuse to go to the bathroom in the sandbox. If in doubt, it's best to use a normal sandbox.
- If the new one is smaller than the old one, you may need to replace the larger one. A large sandbox with a low wall is best; Some people use plastic household containers to make sandboxes.

### 1.6 Clean your cat's feces and urine with an enzyme cleaner. 

When your cat refuses to use the litter box, use an enzyme cleaner specifically designed to remove cat urine (or an enzyme detergent solution mixed with 10% water). Rinse with cold water. This will help deodorize your cat's urine to return to where it was.
- For best results, spray rubbing alcohol on the area that should be cleaned after it has dried. Clean and allow to dry naturally.

### 1.7 Make the area unattractive to cats. 

If your cat becomes in a habit of pooping in certain areas, block the path to that place or try to temporarily stop the cat until it learns good behavior:
- If your cat likes to go to the bathroom in a dark, dark place, have a light, preferably a motion sensor. 
- Cover your cat with tin foil or double-sided tape on carpets or other areas to make her uncomfortable standing on it. 
- If your cat pee into the curtains, hold the curtain up high, out of reach of the cat until it returns to using the litter box.
- Use plastic sheets or bathroom curtains to cover up items your cat might target.
- Leave a little water in the bath or sink when not in use.

### 1.8 Place the sandboxes in problem areas. 

Another solution is to accommodate your cat's liking by placing additional sandboxes where they usually go to the bathroom. Of course, it wouldn't be ideal if the place was the carpet in the middle of the living room, but it would be worth considering if the cat often stains the far corners of the house.
- Another option is to relocate the cat's food bowl. Most cats do not eat and go to the toilet in the same place.

![Retrain-a-Cat-to-Use-the-Litter-Box-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-retrain-a-cat-in-the-litter-box/v4-728px-Retrain-a-Cat-to-Use-the-Litter-Box-Step-9-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 1.9 Take advantage of your cat's whim. 

If none of the above adjustments have worked, you may need to resort to a slower transition option. For example, if your cat likes to pee on the carpet, put a similar mat in the sandbox. If your cat does this, spread some sand over the carpet the next day. Continue adding sand and changing the carpet when it is too dirty until the cat has completely switched to the litter box.
- You may have to keep your cat in an unlined area in your home for a while to make this work or roll the carpet up temporarily. Holding a cat can be counterproductive if the cat is stressed or bored.
- Similarly, if your cat is both indoors and outdoors, add garden soil or sand in the box (no fertilizer). Gradually switch from soil/sand to your cat's litter by adding new litter to the box little by little.

## 2. Handling other causes

![Retrain-a-Cat-to-Use-the-Litter-Box-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-retrain-a-cat-in-the-litter-box/v4-728px-Retrain-a-Cat-to-Use-the-Litter-Box-Step-10-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Spayed cats. 

It's not a must for proper toilet training, but sterilizing your cat will help reduce your cat's ability to pee outside of the litter box. Males that are non-castrated tend to spray their urine very often when they are stressed out, clash with other male cats or "show off" their abilities with female cats.
- The earlier the sterilization is done, the better the cat's ability to prevent this behavior. If this is left on for too long, the habit may persist even after surgery. 

![Retrain-a-Cat-to-Use-the-Litter-Box-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-retrain-a-cat-in-the-litter-box/v4-728px-Retrain-a-Cat-to-Use-the-Litter-Box-Step-11-Version-4.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Reduce stress on your cat.

Like humans, cats can be stressed by changes in the environment or schedule. Your cat may stop using the litter box after another person or animal has left the house, or when another character moves in. Some cats even reacted badly when the house was redecorated. Here are a few ways that may help:
- Create secluded places for the cat to be alone, including in private and high places.
- If your cat is allowed to go outside, let the cat choose where it likes.
- Allow your cat to proactively interact first, and be calm and consistent when it comes to reacting to the cat. Some cats are stressed because they are not having enough play, others do not like to be petted or picked up at any time.
- If your cat's behavior persists, seek advice from a veterinarian or animal behavior specialist.

### 2.3 Respond to cat peeing on vertical surfaces. 

If your cat is leaning against a vertical surface, wiggling its tail and spraying urine, it is marking the territory. If you can't see it, look for spots that smell like urine slightly above the cat's rump and watermarks running down the plank or floor. Any cat can mark territory, but this behavior is most common in male cats that are not castrated. Here's how to do it:
- Marking behavior is often a response to stress or the presence of other cats. Please follow the advice above to handle this problem.
- Spraying can be a response to the arrival of a neighbor's new cat, especially if it is focused on doors, windows, or vents. Try not to let the cat go out into the yard, or pull the curtains down so your cat can't see the other cat.
- About 30% of cats with spraying behavior examined by a veterinarian have health problems. Seeking your cat is a good idea, especially if you can't find a solution that works.

### 2.4 Change the litter box as the kitten gets older. 

If you have been keeping your cat since it was a child, you will need to replace the larger sandbox as the cat gets older. The litter box should be large enough for the cat to comfortably manage and still be able to find a clean spot if you haven't cleaned it up in time.
- Cats don't like change, and it may take a while to get used to the new sandbox. Follow the instructions above if the problem persists.

![Retrain-a-Cat-to-Use-the-Litter-Box-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-retrain-a-cat-in-the-litter-box/v4-728px-Retrain-a-Cat-to-Use-the-Litter-Box-Step-14-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.5 Trim long-haired cats' fur. 

Some long-haired cats will get dirty their fur near the tail when using the toilet. The cat can be painful or uncomfortable, and this causes it to contact the sandbox. If you see this happening, trim the tangled part of the cat's fur in that area.

![Retrain-a-Cat-to-Use-the-Litter-Box-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-retrain-a-cat-in-the-litter-box/v4-728px-Retrain-a-Cat-to-Use-the-Litter-Box-Step-15-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.6 Limit the damage when the cat owner is away. 

Some cats react badly when their owners are away. They may try to urinate where their owner's scent remains, usually in bed. Tell your pet caregiver to close the bedroom door and put more sandboxes so that the cat can find the litter box on her own without someone to walk her.
- If possible, hire a pet caregiver the cat is used to, or at least introduce it to the cat before you leave home.

![Retrain-a-Cat-to-Use-the-Litter-Box-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-retrain-a-cat-in-the-litter-box/v4-728px-Retrain-a-Cat-to-Use-the-Litter-Box-Step-16-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.7 Improve your cat's behavior when you have lots of pets. 

Urine marking is a common response to a cat conflict with another dog or cat, even if they have gotten along in the past. For best results, make sure each child has his or her share so they won't compete:
- Give each pet a sandbox, plus an extra box. Place each box separately in a place with at least two exits if possible.
- Give each child a separate bed and bowl, remember to keep them apart and away from the sandboxes.
- Set aside plenty of private, high-altitude space for each cat.

![Retrain-a-Cat-to-Use-the-Litter-Box-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-retrain-a-cat-in-the-litter-box/v4-728px-Retrain-a-Cat-to-Use-the-Litter-Box-Step-17-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.8 Keep each pet separate if the bad behavior persists. 

If your cat still refuses to poop in the sandbox or is still in conflict with other animals, try a more thorough separation of them. This is often essential when you bring a new cat home:
- Separate each cat into each room and close the door so that they cannot see each other but can smell each other. Help them get used to each other's scent by feeding them on either side of the door or by having them change rooms every day.
- After a few days, open the door a crack. If they don't react badly, let them contact each other.
- If the animals are aggressive, leash them at a safe distance in the same room in short bursts so they can play or eat, and gradually bring them closer together.
- When the cats calm down, try rubbing some tuna juice over their heads. This encourages them to relax by licking and even licking each other.

## 3. Eliminate health problem

![Retrain-a-Cat-to-Use-the-Litter-Box-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-retrain-a-cat-in-the-litter-box/v4-728px-Retrain-a-Cat-to-Use-the-Litter-Box-Step-18-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Evaluate if your cat is having difficulty urinating. 

If you notice that your cat seems stressed while urinating or is struggling for a long time, then you need to take your cat to the vet right away. Male cats, in particular, can develop urinary tract disease when the urethra (the tube from the bladder to the penis) is narrow or blocked. Usually, a small amount of urine will flow through until it is completely blocked and the cat is unable to urinate. This is a life-threatening case and requires immediate medical attention. An obstruction can also occur in the intestinal tract.
-Some cats with a urinary tract infection or have a blocked urinary tract have to manage a long time when urinating, licking their genitals, or calling their owner.

![Retrain-a-Cat-to-Use-the-Litter-Box-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-retrain-a-cat-in-the-litter-box/v4-728px-Retrain-a-Cat-to-Use-the-Litter-Box-Step-19-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Evaluate if your cat is having trouble defecating. 

Constipation can become chronic, requiring your cat to be on a special diet and using laxatives. Diarrhea is also not uncommon, including chronic diarrhea associated with inflammatory bowel disease. These diseases are both annoying and can cause your cat to be afraid of the litter box or not make it to the litter box in time to avoid problems.
- For some reason, many cats with inflammatory bowel disease experience only occasional symptoms. Loss of appetite, lethargy, vomiting, or a lot of hairs in the stomach can all be signs of bowel discomfort.

![Retrain-a-Cat-to-Use-the-Litter-Box-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-retrain-a-cat-in-the-litter-box/v4-728px-Retrain-a-Cat-to-Use-the-Litter-Box-Step-20-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Make it easier for the cat to access the sandbox. 

If your cat is old or injured, it may not be able to get in and out of the sandbox as easily as before. Does your cat have a limp, need help to jump into a chair or bed, have her legs trembled, or seem to have spinal or tail pain? If so, you need to get your cat to the vet right away! You can make your cat more comfortable by using a low-walled sandbox or a cut “entrance” on the side of the box. You may also want to consider using a larger box so that the cat can easily turn around when in the box.
- An overweight cat may no longer fit in the litter box. Look for a larger sandbox and give your cat a diet. Ask your veterinarian about safe weight loss strategies for your cat.

![Retrain-a-Cat-to-Use-the-Litter-Box-Step-21]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-retrain-a-cat-in-the-litter-box/v4-728px-Retrain-a-Cat-to-Use-the-Litter-Box-Step-21-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Talk with your vet to rule out other health problems. 

A cat's pee outside of the litter box is often caused by a cat's health problems, including urinary tract infections, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hyperthyroidism, and cystitis with or without clear crystals. urine, and intestinal diseases. If in doubt, take your cat to see the vet.
- Observe the cat for a response when the veterinarian asks. Questions might include: Is your cat pee right next to the sandbox or is it far away? Is the urine too much? Has a cat ever tried to pee in the litter box? Does it sound when urinating? Does it drink more water? Is your cat's urine almost transparent, normal color, or dark? Do cats pee many times?
- Even without health problems, a doctor can prescribe anti-anxiety medications for cats to prevent territorial marking behavior. This is not a guaranteed or risk-free solution, so talk with your doctor about the pros and cons of this treatment.

> Advice
- You may need to look for hard-to-see urine stains in places like under carpets, mattresses, and floors. Ultraviolet light used in the dark will make urine stains light up.
- If you have a lot of cats and are unsure of which one is peeing outside the litter box, talk to your veterinarian about giving fluorescein to each cat. This is a harmless dye that temporarily works to make cat urine glow blue under ultraviolet light. Another way is to keep each cat in a separate room until you find the "culprit".
- If your dog is disturbing the cat while he is defecating in the litter box or trying to pamper the cat's litter box, block your dog's access to the litter box with the baby door. Raise the door high enough so that only a cat can get under it, but the dog cannot. 

> Warning
- Do not punish the cat for refusing to use the litter box, including holding its nose in urine or feces. This behavior will not improve your cat's behavior.
- Do not wash your cat's urine with ammonia-based detergent. The urine contains ammonia, so the smell of ammonia can attract the cat back to where it was to urinate.
- Urine marking is more common if you keep a lot of cats in confined spaces. According to some studies, this is almost impossible to avoid in homes with ten or more cats. 
- Cats that mark their territories under stress often return to this behavior when faced with a new source of anxiety. If this happens, getting your cat to the doctor in time may help you find ways to cope with the habit more easily.
