> Cats often feel happy when it is time to eat and may eat too much or too quickly. They can then induce vomiting, upset digestion, or be overweight from eating too quickly and too much. Owners of cats can help cats eat slowly and properly using a dedicated plate and several other feeding techniques.

## 1. Use a special plate of food

### 1.1 Divide the cat food into sections on a flat plate or tray. 

To allow your cat to eat and drink slowly, you can place the dry food on a flat baking dish or plate. This causes the cat to eat only a small amount at once and chew the food well.

### 1.2 Keep the food wet on the bottom of the bowl. 

This will help your cat eat more slowly because it cannot finish all the food. Instead, your cat will have to slowly find a way to eat small pieces and swallow before eating another.

### 1.3 Place the golf ball in the center of the cat's food bowl. 

The ball acts as a hindrance to your cat from eating more slowly because she needs to stop while eating to push obstacles or eat food that is stuck around the obstruction.
- Use an obstruction that cannot be swallowed, such as a golf ball or table tennis.

### 1.4 Use a food bowl with a fixed tube in the middle. 

Many pet stores sell pet bowls with a large tube in the middle of the bowl or multiple small tubes. This bowl will help the cat eat more slowly and chew the food thoroughly.

### 1.5 Buy automatic feeding equipment. 

This tool helps the pet owner to control the pet's food intake with the simple press of a button. Many tools have digital settings so you know the exact amount of food your cat eats at a time. There are also parameters on the tool to help you determine the amount of food for the cat and avoid overfeeding or too little.
- You can set up a feeder to let your cat eat small amounts of food in a day, helping her slow down and prevent overeating.

## 2. Use a different feeding technique

### 2.1 Feed your cat several small meals throughout the day. 

If your cat eats too quickly and is vomiting or starts to have gastrointestinal symptoms such as flatulence, you will need to adjust her feeding schedule. Instead of eating three large meals a day, break it into five to five for one to two weeks.
- After a week or two, check to see if a new eating schedule will help your cat slow down. Eating several small meals throughout the day will help your pet digest the right food and maintain his appetite for the next meal.
- You can also place food on a small plate around the house to force the cat to move around to eat more. This helps the pet see mealtime as a “hunt,” mentally and physically stimulated, as well as causing them to control themselves while they are eating.

### 2.2 Put dry food in a food ball and turn it into an eating game. 

Your cat may be able to play with it while enjoying the food in a balloon. This will help your cat slow down and encourage her to use hunting skills to get food.
- To give your cat a chance to train, you can use a food ball during play to encourage your cat to try to grab food and prevent it from overheating or overeating.

### 2.3 Prepare several bowls of food for each cat. 

If you have a lot of cats, you may experience one child bullying the other and eating all of their portions, or one child taking up all of it when it's time to eat. You can solve this problem by preparing multiple food bowls indoors, preferably in a different room or area of ​​the house. This will help separate the cats while eating and ensure that each of the cats is eating their own portion. 
- Prepare bowls of food with a scattered amount of food throughout the day for the cats to slow down their feeding rate.

### 2.4 See your vet if it continues to eat too quickly and shows signs of lack of food. 

If you've followed the steps above but your cat continues to eat too fast and shows no signs of gaining or not being full enough, they may have a health problem that needs to be fixed. See your vet for a checkup to make sure that eating a lot or quickly is not a symptom of illness.
