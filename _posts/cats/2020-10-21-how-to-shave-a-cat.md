> The cat's fur turned into a mess? Cats have long hairs and need to be trimmed? In these cases, you can shave your pet. While shaving a cat should be a professional, you can do it at home as long as you consult your doctor first. Also, use only appropriate tools and methods. If you are carefully prepared and prepared, you can safely shave your cat.

## 1. Consider shaving your cat

![Shave-a-Cat-Step-1]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-shave-a-cat/v4-728px-Shave-a-Cat-Step-1-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.1 Consider shaving your cat. 

If your cat's fur is messy, you can shave it. Ruffled hair can cause discoloration and scarring of your cat's skin. After that, you need to schedule a regular cleaning schedule for your cat. Other reasons to shave your cat include allergies, hair buns, dirty anus, and heavy hair loss. In these cases, you can reduce the thickness of the hair by trimming it. In general, you should not shave your cat if it is not absolutely necessary.
- Cat fur is an insulating effect in the summer and keeps it warm in the winter. If you shave too much of the cat's hair, you will interfere with its air conditioning function.
- If you are a long-haired cat, consider brushing to keep them cool instead of shaving.
- Not all cats should be shaven. Aggressive cats, elderly, or sick cats may become stressed or injured while shaving.

### 1.2 Consider choosing a pet groomer. 

Check prices and locations. A pet groomer is skilled at handling the cat's coat. While the service usually costs more than self-shaving at home, it is also worth the cost. They rarely injure cats and also know how to reassure a pet while shaving.
- The price depends on the service. The basic cleaning package (instead of a complete shave) costs less.

### 1.3 Talk to your veterinarian. 

To be safe, consult your veterinarian before shaving your cat. If your cat's fur is tangled, your veterinarian can remove it. In addition, your doctor may advise against shaving your cat, or only doing it during certain seasons, and recommend a hygienist or proper equipment.

## 2. Get ready to shave your cat

### 2.1 Prepare the necessary tools. 

If you decide to shave your cat at home, be prepared to make it all go smoothly. Prepare rubber gloves (to prevent scratches), towels, brushes, snacks, razors, and # 10 razor blades. You can buy a razor at a pet store or on the internet. Buy pet tools instead of people.
- Do not use a razor blade.

![Shave-a-Cat-Step-5]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-shave-a-cat/v4-728px-Shave-a-Cat-Step-5-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Find someone to help. 

You will have difficulty shaving your cat yourself. It is best to find a support person to hold the pet in a grip while shaving. Look for someone who has been in contact with the cat, such as a spouse, children, or neighbor. Cats will trust these people more than strangers.
- Training your cat associates shaving with positive things, such as cuddles and rewards. Show your pet the utensils you are going to use and then reward the food, praise, or cuddle it.
- When you start shaving your pet, first let the other person stroke the cat on the shaving table to calm him down. When the cat purrs, the support person should gently hold the cat with both hands. There will come a time when the support person needs to hold the cat in his arms, like when handling the tail.

### 2.3 Choose a location. 

Determine where to start shaving. Note that the hairs will be scattered heavily on the ground, so choose a location with tile or wood floors instead of carpeted floors, such as the kitchen or bathroom. Shaving your cat in a familiar location will help him stay calm.
- Find a table to put the cat on. Choose a table that you don't mind being scratched or soiled.

### 2.4 Groom your cat. 

You should clean the cat's fur before you shave. Brushing works to remove dirt, evenly disperse the natural oils on the bristles, untangle, and keep the skin surface clean and non-irritated. If your cat has short hairs, you only need to brush once a week. If your cat has long hairs, you should brush weekly. To brush your cat, follow these steps:
- Use a metal comb.
- Brush from head to tail. Start in the abdomen and legs. Work gently on the chest and abdomen.
- Remove tangled hair.
- Use a hairbrush or rubber comb to remove dead and loose hair.
- Brush in an upward direction.
- Comb the tail by turning the middle part and brushing the bristles on the sides.

### 2.5 Choose coat style. 

There are many ways to shave your cat. You should be prepared before shaving your pet. Determine the reason (hygiene, age, length of the coat, etc.) for shaving before choosing a style.
- Shave around the anus for easier cleaning.
- Shaving your abdomen helps prevent frequent ruffles from occurring.
- Shaving with a comb will only partially trim the hair and make the coat thinner. This is suitable for hair loss reduction purposes.
- A popular style that helps reduce hair loss is the lion's mane. With this pattern, the facial hair is retained but the body hair is completely shaved.

## 3. Follow general instructions when shaving

![Shave-a-Cat-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-shave-a-cat/v4-728px-Shave-a-Cat-Step-9.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Cool the razor. 

Do not shave your cat too long with an electric knife as it will heat up. Take a break from shaving to let the knife cool. Cat skin is very sensitive, so be careful about the temperature of the razor.
- Use lubricating oil to aid in shaving.

![Shave-a-Cat-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-shave-a-cat/v4-728px-Shave-a-Cat-Step-10.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Stretch your pet's skin. When shaving your cat, stretch her skin to avoid injuring her. Calming the cat before doing this. You can also ask someone else to help you with this step.

![Shave-a-Cat-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-shave-a-cat/v4-728px-Shave-a-Cat-Step-11.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Move the razor properly. Move the razor in the direction the hair is lying down. Glide the razor on the surface. Do not put pressure on the razor, as it can scratch the skin and cause a painful rash that will cause your cat to lick it to reduce inflammation and often cause infection.

Shaving in the opposite direction of the fur can scratch your cat's skin.

![Shave-a-Cat-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-shave-a-cat/v4-728px-Shave-a-Cat-Step-12.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Don't shave too close. 

Leave the fur about 3 cm long to protect the cat from the sun and cold temperatures. Shaving too closely can cause the protective coat to sink into the skin causing abnormal hair growth as well as skin problems

![Shave-a-Cat-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-shave-a-cat/v4-728px-Shave-a-Cat-Step-13.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Avoid dangerous areas. 

Do not shave your legs and feet, concentrating on sensitive skin, ligaments, and tendons. Do not shave (near the muzzle, above eyes, and behind front foot). If your cat becomes agitated when you shave near these parts, stop immediately.

## 4. Partial shade

### 4.1 Shave hygiene. 

This shaving style is suitable for long-haired and overweight cats and is quite practical. This will help keep your cat's fur from getting dirty after using the toilet. You should shave your cat in this manner every six weeks.
- Use the razor with blade # 10.
- Keep the cat still.
- Trim the hair around the anus. Be careful not to injure the cat.

![Shave-a-Cat-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-shave-a-cat/v4-728px-Shave-a-Cat-Step-15.jpg.webp)

### 4.2 Shave your cat's belly. 

This shave works well for long-haired cats and removes most of the under-belly hair. This is a part of the hygienic shave that makes it easier for cats to clean themselves. Shaving your belly helps prevent tangles and excessive hair loss. You cannot see the shaved belly while the cat is walking. 
- Use a suitable razor.
- Skin stretching.
- Shave under the tail and around the rectum.
- Shave your hind legs.
- Shave from your abdomen up to the armpits of your front leg.

![Shave-a-Cat-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-shave-a-cat/v4-728px-Shave-a-Cat-Step-16.jpg.webp)

### 4.3 Use a shaving brush. 

This shave leaves the cat's body hair about 1 to 2.5 cm long. You will shorten the hair, but not completely. This shaving helps keep your cat's hair from getting messy. Shaving with a comb reduces hair loss and forms hairs. You can also check the cat's body for skin problems.
- Insert the comb tip into the razor.
- Start trimming the hair behind the ears.
- Prune the cat's back under the tail.
- Prune the cat's shoulders and sides.
- Put the cat on its side.
- Prune the cat's belly.
- Prune the cat's legs.

## 5. Shave the lion's mane

![Shave-a-Cat-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-shave-a-cat/v4-728px-Shave-a-Cat-Step-17.jpg.webp)

### 5.1 Shave your back. 

Begin near the base of the tail on the cat's back. Use a knife with blade # 10 and shave against the direction of hair growth. Shave from back to head. 

![Shave-a-Cat-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-shave-a-cat/v4-728px-Shave-a-Cat-Step-18.jpg.webp)

### 5.2 Shave your chest.

Do this under the cat's belly. First, shave along the direction of hair growth to remove hair and get a better look. Then, reverse the razor's direction and head upwards for a smoother shave. 

![Shave-a-Cat-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-shave-a-cat/v4-728px-Shave-a-Cat-Step-19.jpg.webp)

### 5.3 Choose tailcoat. 

For the lion's mane, there are two main types of tail shaving: shaving off the tailor leaving the top round. Check for the round cusp with the fur underneath the tail. You can choose a shaving style depending on your preference. Here are the steps to perform each shave:
- For full-tail shave, move the razor down the base of the tail to create a line. Turn the knife upside down to scrape it up and let out a clean line that joins the cat's back. Shave the lower part of the tail. Shave in a smooth path.
- For a shaved top, keep the tail 5 to 8 cm long with one hand. Use the other hand to shave down the trail until the tip is round. Use the razor blade to create a circular cone similar to when shaving the tail. Then invert the razor, shaving it upwards over the body. Shave all the sides of the tail to reveal a smooth, even skin.

![Shave-a-Cat-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-shave-a-cat/v4-728px-Shave-a-Cat-Step-20.jpg.webp)

### 5.4 Shave your front legs and armpits. 

Keep the cat's legs apart. Stretch the thin skin of the armpits to avoid injuring the cat. Shave up and across the elbows about 3 cm. Using bald underfoot, sweep forward and evenly on all sides. Again, use the razor in the direction of the hair growth to create a line. Reverse the razor and scrape in the direction of hair growth so that the skin surface is smooth and clearly defined.

![Shave-a-Cat-Step-21]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-shave-a-cat/v4-728px-Shave-a-Cat-Step-21.jpg.webp)

### 5.5 Shave your hind legs.

First, separate the legs of the cat. Shave in a downward direction to remove the coat and get a better view. Then shave in the opposite direction of the hair growth. Shave until it hits the spot just above the ankle.

![Shave-a-Cat-Step-22]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-shave-a-cat/v4-728px-Shave-a-Cat-Step-22.jpg.webp)

### 5.6 Shave the neckline. 

Pull the neck forward and start shaving the back of the neck. Stretches the skin and back. Shave forward in the direction of hair growth. Imagine a cat wearing a necklace. Use the natural necklace as support. After the lines are evenly placed on the back of the neck, move forward in front of the cat's chin. Shave towards the natural neckline. Then scrape the sides of the neck to merge the front and back lines together with the natural necklace.

## 6. Take care of your cat after shaving

### 6.1 Bathe your cat. 

After shaving your cat's fur, you can bathe your cat to remove the grease. Use a shampoo that is suitable for cats. You can buy bath oils on the internet or at a pet store. If your cat's skin is sensitive, your veterinarian can recommend the right shower oil. Follow these steps:
- Place a rubber mat under the sink or tub so that the cat's paw holds in.
- Fill the tub with warm water about 8 to 10 cm.
- Put the cat in the tub.
- Use a spray hose to wet your cat's entire body. Do not spray directly into ears, eyes, or nose. You can use a mug or scoop instead of a hose.
- Gently massage the bath oil on the cat's body. Do it from head to tail.
- Use a clean hose for the cat. This step should also avoid the ears, eyes, and nose.
- Use a large towel to dry the cat.

### 6.2 Drying. 

After bathing, you can use a hairdryer to dry the cat. Turn on "cool" mode so you don't harm your skin. Remove the tangled hair and dry the coat evenly to make it soft and smooth. 

![Shave-a-Cat-Step-25]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-shave-a-cat/v4-728px-Shave-a-Cat-Step-25.jpg.webp)

### 6.3 Apply sunscreen. 

Cat's fur works to prevent skin cancer by blocking harmful UV rays. When you shave your cat, she loses this protective layer. Apply pet sunscreen to avoid sunburn and skin cancer. You can buy sunscreen on the internet like Amazon or at a pet store.

> Advice
- If you opt for a full-body shave, such as a lion's mane, break the process into sessions with 15-minute sessions over several days. This will give you and your pet a break between shave intervals.

> Warning
- Do not provoke the cat in any way.
- Do not give your cat sedatives without the supervision of a veterinarian.
