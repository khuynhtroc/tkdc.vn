> When you notice that your cat's behavior has changed recently, she is probably under stress. Our concept of stress is different from that of cats, and sometimes even a little thing disturbs their well-being. Changes in everyday life, feral cats appearing in the garden, new litter, an owner traveling long distances, or visiting a vet can all be unhappy. Not only is stress uncomfortable for your cat (and you), but has potential health effects such as impaired immunity, increased risk of infection, and excessive hair licking. Therefore, it is very important to adopt ways to reduce stress in cats. 

## 1. Detect symptoms of stress in cats

![Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-1]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-reduce-stress-in-cats/v4-728px-Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-1-Version-6.jpg.webp)

### 1.1 Watch for changes in the cat's poop. 

Difficult urination is often a common result of stress. Hormones that cause stress cause a cat's bladder to become inflamed, causing physical symptoms. Keep track of your cat's frequency of pooping. Signs that they are having problems are frequent urination, difficulty urinating, and blood in the urine.
- These signs should not be ignored; you should see the vet in such cases. Otherwise, a bladder infection can cause a cat's very serious and life-threatening blockage if left untreated.

### 1.2 Recognize excessive hair licking. 

Stressful cats often lick their fur, and this happens so often that it sheds hair on their skin. Places that the cat often licks include the abdomen, inner thighs, and front legs. The act of fur licking releases natural morphine that makes the cat feel more comfortable and safe.
- Seek medical attention before you conclude that the cause is stress (allergies and parasites cause your cat to act too much).

### 1.3 Pay attention to diarrhea. 

Some cats experience stress that can upset their stomachs and lead to diarrhea. Whatever the cause (stress or infection), you should seek medical attention for diarrhea treatment with medication.

### 1.4 Know if your cat is defecating outside of the tray. 

They do this because they feel so stressed that they cannot use the tray, or to mark the smell around the house to make the cat feel more secure.
- However, other problems including arthritis, cystitis, or upset stomach are still the same, so you should still take your cat to the vet.

### 1.5 Be aware of if you are meowing or making too many calls. 

Some cats become too close to their owners and try to get attention by communicating.

### 1.6 Realize that restlessness is also a sign of stress. 

Cats that encounter this condition cannot lie still and can move around non-stop, protecting their territory by observing any potential threats.

### 1.7 Note if the cat stays away from humans. 

A cat that feels overwhelmed may hide under a bed or in a dark corner. they hide to avoid stressful things.

### 1.8 Watch for any signs of changing eating habits. 

Some stressed cats have anorexia, while others eat something else like chewing cloth.

### 1.9 Identify the cause of your cat's stress. 

Find out when and why your symptoms are. This step helps you identify ways to minimize the source of stress, whether physically, environmentally, or psychologically involved. Your veterinarian also wants to know when you notice the signs.

## 2. Reduce physical stress

![Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-reduce-stress-in-cats/v4-728px-Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-10-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Take your cat to the doctor if any signs of health are affected. 

Many symptoms of stress are similar to symptoms of physical illness. Identify if your cat is sick or stressed (in some cases it can lead to stress).

![Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-reduce-stress-in-cats/v4-728px-Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-11-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Pruning too long toenails are painful for cats.

Sometimes a simple solution can overcome the stress of having long, long toenails digging into your cat's meat cushion. 

![Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-reduce-stress-in-cats/v4-728px-Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-12-Version-6.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Destroying flea bites. 

Flea bites into the skin, causing cat irritation; Worse yet, cats that eat fleas can become infected with tapeworms. If your cat is scratching continuously and nonstop, check the specific area. Buy a flea comb and brush the fur around the neck and tail: if you see small, pin-sized brown spots, your cat has been infected with fleas. In addition, you should also note small white or black spots on the comb teeth: these are flea eggs and dried blood excreted by the flea. If you find a flea, you will need to get it completely eradicated on the cat's body and indoors.
- To get rid of fleas in cats, you should consult with your doctor about an appropriate flea control program for them.
- As for the part of getting rid of fleas at home, you need to take a number of measures including vacuuming your cat's regular areas, carpets, and furniture; Wash your cat's bedding weekly and can safely use a spray bottle, mist, or powder (follow product instructions carefully and keep your cat out of the area specified in the instructions).

## 3. Minimize environmental pressure

![Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-reduce-stress-in-cats/v4-728px-Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-13-Version-6.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Adjust music at a low volume. 

Cats have sensitive hearing and may be hurt by music, television, or loud sound sources.
- Reassure your cat of fear of loud outside noises, especially fireworks or lightning. Move the cat into the room or close the curtains, turn on the low-volume TV or radio, and set up hiding places until the fear is over.

![Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-reduce-stress-in-cats/v4-728px-Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-14-Version-6.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Know when to reassure your cat. 

Some cats that have a deep relationship with their owners will benefit from friendship and comfort (such as cats hiding in their owners during a thunderstorm outside: they feel at peace by the scent of humans. on the mattress bed). However, the cat is so scared that it will actually be hurt that it cannot accept peace and sees the human intervention as another threat.
- In general, if the cat backs away, growls, screeches, or whips its tail, leave it alone. On the other hand, you should increase the security of the hiding place, such as spreading a towel over the box the cat is hiding in to cover the front edge of the shield from the cat's outward visibility.

![Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-reduce-stress-in-cats/v4-728px-Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-15-Version-6.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Provide a safe indoor location for cats. 

The lack of shelter also stresses the cat. The fact that they feel exposed due to the lack of resting places up high to observe things around or no dark roars to hide is considerable pressure. Just fix the problem by placing the cardboard box in a quiet corner of the room, or by installing a tall pillar or a grinding column.

![Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-reduce-stress-in-cats/v4-728px-Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-16-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Create a peaceful, stable atmosphere in the house.

Cats are very sensitive to changes in their environment. Some situations are usually unavoidable (moving house, for example), but keep as quiet as possible. The act of arguing and yelling not only makes you feel pressured but also the cat feels pressure.
- If your home is undergoing renovation work, pay more attention to your cat and help it get through this difficult time. Always provide shelter for your cat. 

![Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-reduce-stress-in-cats/v4-728px-Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-17-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Do not scold the cat. 

Cats don't understand the relationship between scolding or beating and their wrongdoing, so such punishment will only make the cat feel pressured and scared.
- Instead, use positive reinforcement to encourage good behavior in your cat. Whenever they do something "good", like sharpening their claws with a pillar, you can reward your cat with food and praise. Note giving rewards immediately: cats have short-term concentration, so if the rewards appear too slow, they will not know why they were rewarded.

## 4. Reduce psychological stress

![Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-reduce-stress-in-cats/v4-728px-Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-18-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Give your cat a chance to do some challenging activities. 

Encourage your cat to engage in some energy-burning activities like hunting or playing. This step is especially important for domestic cats, as they lack the same psychological stimulation as outdoors. In addition, making the cat feel tired enough can help dissolve stress and release stress hormones through physical activity instead of licking too much hair.
- Hide treats or dry food around the house and let your cat find it on her own.
- Set aside at least three sessions of 10 minutes each to play with your cat. Lure a toy to let your cat run after it, or throw it around the room. Cats love to hunt and pounce.
- If you have a lot of cats, plan time to play with each one each day in addition to group playtime.
- Provide toys for your cat. Prepare a variety of toys, but only a few at a time. Every few days, you pick up all the toys and replace them with some new ones.

![Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-reduce-stress-in-cats/v4-728px-Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-19-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 4.2 Provide another type of entertainment. 

Place the bird feeder outside the window as a pastime for the cat, or buy a tank for them to watch the fish swimming in.

![Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-reduce-stress-in-cats/v4-728px-Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-20-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 4.3 Minimize competition among cats in the house. 

If you have a lot of cats, they can scramble for food, water, litter boxes, and even attention. Competitive pressure can make your cat feel like he's being bullied. To reduce stress, you need to satisfy each child's needs.
- Each cat should have its own litter box, and add a spare to reduce the competition for the litter area. You need to clean the litter box, empty the waste daily and clean it regularly with a mild detergent or a water-based detergent (1:30 ratio).
- Place lots of food bowls around the house so that no one can monopolize the food the entire time.

![Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-21]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-reduce-stress-in-cats/v4-728px-Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-21-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 4.4 Prevent stray cats from approaching your home. 

Feral cats that appear in the garden, or even indoors (they can get in through a cat door!) Can make your cat feel emotionally threatened.
- Keep stray cats out of the way by disposing of food that is attractive to them.
- When the cat runs out, install a small door with a trigger chip so that the stray cat cannot get inside.
- In the event that the stressed cat sees a stray cat in the garden, you can block the bottom of the window to block the view (this is similar to the cat burying its head in the sand, but it is a good way to go. effective).

## 5. Help your cat feel safe

![Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-22]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-reduce-stress-in-cats/v4-728px-Reduce-Stress-in-Cats-Step-22-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 5.1 Consider using pheromones in cats to help keep your cat happy. 

A nursing female cat releases pheromones (chemical scents) that help the kitten feel safe and content. Feliway is manufactured and marketed as a synthetic analog of the cat pheromone.
- Use a Feliway mist in a small amount on your bed, or entrance, to mark your cat's territory.
- Alternatively, you can purchase a Feliway diffuser. The diffuser runs on electricity and releases low levels of pheromones into the air (no effect on humans!). Plug the diffuser into a socket in a location where your cat spends time. The effect will usually form slowly, so you should not expect immediate results. However, after a few weeks, you should notice a change in your cat's behavior as she feels safer and more secure. (Each diffuser lasts for 4 weeks and you can replace it with a new one.)

### 5.2 Give your cat Zylkene. 

Zylkene is a food medicine or supplement that has a positive effect on the organism. Food medications are not medicines, so they are safe and side effects are rare. The main ingredient in Zylkene is extracted from milk protein and has a sedative effect on the brain. They are effective in calming cats and relieving stress and anxiety.
- Zylkene is available over the counter as a 75 mg soft capsule. Give your cat one 75 mg tablet daily, with or after meals. They take a few days to work, but if you don't notice a noticeable change after seven days, they may not work for your cat.

### 5.3 Talk to your veterinarian about medications that help manage stress. 

If your cat is too stressed out to become sick, the vet will prescribe medication to help it get through this difficult time. Some of the commonly used drugs today are diazepam, amitriptyline, and fluoxetine.
- The drugs listed above are not licensed for use in cats because the manufacturer does not spend money testing their effectiveness. However, there is still evidence to suggest that it is safe to use in cats and that your veterinarian will discuss with you if this is the best treatment.
