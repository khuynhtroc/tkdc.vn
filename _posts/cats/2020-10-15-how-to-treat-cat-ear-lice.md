## 1.	Identify the cat with ear lice

### 1.1 Pay attention if the earwax is too much. 

Ear lice often irritate the ear canal lining and cause increased secretion of earwax. This wax is usually brown/black in color and sometimes looks like a normal cat wax. 
- If your cat's ears are healthy, they usually produce very little wax. If you find that your cat's ears have coffee grounds or dirty black spots, the cat is most likely having a problem. 
- Cats secrete earwax as a mechanism against the effects of infection.
- You may also notice an odor coming from the cat's ears.

### 1.2 Pay attention when the cat scratches and shakes its head. 

Ear lice can cause irritation that causes cats to constantly scratch their ears with their hind legs and / or shake their head frequently. 
- Cat's claw can tear the skin, causing pain, bleeding, and even infection.
- Cats with long-term ear lice are at risk for inflamed polyps (tumor-shaped lesions) in the ear canal, which will swell and bleed from the cat's constant scratching and scratching.
- In addition, your cat's outer ear may become inflamed and drain, or the eardrum may tear and lead to an imbalance or other problems that require medical attention.

### 1.3 Observe the cat's posture.

Cats with ear lice often tilt their head to one side. These are general signs that your cat has an ear problem, not just the ear lice.
- Regardless of the cause, it's a good idea to get your cat to the vet if it's constantly tilting its head to the side.

### 1.4 Check out other animals. 

If you have multiple pets and suspect that one has ear lice, you should check all of the pet's ears. Ear lice are easily spread from animal to animal when they sleep together or lick each other's feathers.
- If you treat only each cat with ear lice, other cats are likely to carry this parasite but show no signs, so the lice can spread and re-infect.
- If a pet has ear lice, treat all pets in the house to prevent the risk of infection.

### 1.5 Take your cat to the vet. 

If you notice any of these signs, you should take your cat to the vet. A veterinarian can diagnose a cat in several ways.
- Your veterinarian can examine your cat's ear canal with an Auroscope - a device similar to an amplified flashlight to see deeply into the ear canal. The veterinarian can directly observe the small white lice running back and forth under the influence of Auroscope light. 
- Some doctors may collect a cotton swab sample and place the wax on a microscope slide for viewing. Ear lice can be seen under a microscope.
- Your doctor may also check to make sure your cat's eardrums are not damaged before treatment, as the eardrum acts as a barrier to prevent water from entering the middle ear and causing an imbalance in your cat.

## 2.	Treat ear lice with ear drops

### 2.1 Get medication for treatment. 

After diagnosing and determining that the eardrum is not damaged, your veterinarian can prescribe ear drops that are safe and effective in killing the cat's ear lice.
- Many pet stores sell over-the-counter lice treatments that are ineffective and can be harmful to cats. Ideally, use only medications recommended by your veterinarian.

### 2.2 Carefully read the medicine bottle label. 

You should carefully read the instructions on how often to administer the drops on the label. The frequency and dosage of the ear drops depend on the medicine, but usually, you can administer it to a cat's ear once a day for 7-10 days.

### 2.3 Prepare your cat's ears. 

Before you administer the drops to your cat, you should put all the necessary items on a table or flat surface.
- You will need a large towel spread over the table to prevent the cat from slipping, ear drops, and some cotton balls.
- If possible, you can have your cat's keeper help you to keep your cat's drops two hands-frees.

### 2.4 Clean the cat's ears. 

Before you administer the drops, clean the cat's ears. It is advisable to consult your veterinarian about a cat's ear cleaning routine before children. 
- Buy an ear cleaner that is labeled as safe for the cat and follow the instructions.
- Be careful if there is too much earwax in your cat's ears, as earwax can act like a cocoon that covers ear lice, making ear drops inaccessible.

### 2.5 Small pills.

Position the cat across from you and have someone gently press down on the cat's shoulder to prevent it from moving. Cut off the tip of the bottle and place each drop of the correct dose into the cat's ear canal.
- Use your thumb and index finger to gently rub the cat's ears to let the drops through the wax and deeper into the ear canal. 
- If your cat is resistant to the installation, wrap the cat in a towel to keep it still.

### 2.6 Clean your ears.

Use a cotton ball to wipe off any excess surface of the ear.
- Do not push the cotton pad into the ear canal. If your cat moves while cleaning the ear, the cotton ball will easily go deep into the ear and cause injury.

### 2.7 Repeat drops according to the instructions. 

You should give the cat the drops every day for the allotted time. If your cat still shows signs of irritation at the end of treatment, you should seek medical attention.
- Stop treatment and contact your veterinarian if the cat continues to tilt its head during treatment.
- Some cats may be sensitive to the ingredients in the ear drops and become unbalanced by the medication even if the eardrum is not damaged. If this is the case, take your cat to the vet immediately.

## 3.	Prevent re-infection of ear lice

[Get-Rid-of-Ear-Mites-in-a-Cat-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-treat-cat-ear-lice/v4-728px-Get-Rid-of-Ear-Mites-in-a-Cat-Step-13-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Use Selamectin for all cats. 

Selamectin is a powerful parasitic control drug available for both cats and dogs. This drug helps to fight lice, fleas, filariasis, and some intestinal helminths. You should use topically for all cats in the house with a Selamectin-containing medicine such as Revolution (or Stronghold from the UK).
- Selamectin helps prevent reinfection and protects other cats from parasitic infections.
- You should apply Selamectin on the nape of the cat's nape. Do not apply Selamectin to cat ears.

### 3.2 Take the dog to the vet. 

Selamectin is not licensed to treat ear lice in dogs. If your dog gets ear lice from a cat, you should see the vet for preventive treatment.

### 3.3 Protect the cat's paws. 

You should spray Fipronil topical medication on your cat's hind legs to kill ticks, fleas, lice, and other parasites. This medication can directly kill any lice that get on the fur after a cat scratches the ear.
- This medication helps prevent reinfection from occurring when cats scratching clean ears with their feet with lice still attached. 
- Fipronil is found in many drugs such as Frontline, Effipro, Barricade, and EasySpot. You should consult with your veterinarian about antiparasitic drugs and reliable suppliers.

> Advice
- Do not be too concerned, as cat ear lice cannot be transmitted to humans.
- You can also treat the cat's ear lice with a topical medication that contains selamectin to prevent reinfection. Once applied to the skin, Selamectin will be absorbed into the bloodstream and placed in the ear canal to kill the lice that eat the debris. Selamectin alone is enough to treat the infection caused by ear lice. While this method is very convenient, ear drops are still preferred for their anti-inflammatory and antibiotic properties to fight secondary infections. 

> Warning
- Infection caused by ear lice can become serious if left untreated. Severe ear lice infections can damage your cat's ear canal and eardrums. Ear lice are very contagious and can be spread from cat to cat or cat to dog and vice versa, so you should treat all pets in the house at the same time.
- Over-the-counter medications are generally ineffective and dangerous for cats. These medications can cause serious nerve damage in your cat.
