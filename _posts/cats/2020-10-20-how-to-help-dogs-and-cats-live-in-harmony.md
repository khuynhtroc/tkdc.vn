### 1.2 Slow but sure! DO NOT let the dog chase the cat around. 

First, keep them separate for 3-4 days, then let the dogs and cats meet in person. Animals take time to get used to each other's scent and adjust to a new home first to be able to accept a meeting with the other.
- Dogs and cats tend to fight or be unhappy if you force them together suddenly. Keep pets in a separate room and keep them out of sight until you are both calm.
- Start mixing pet odors by petting the cat, then petting the dog, and vice versa (if they are in separate rooms).

### 1.4 Let dogs and cats smell each other through the gap under the door that separates them. 

Pets will be able to interact with new scents by smelling them directly on a particular pet even if they can't see each other.

### 1.9 Continue letting the dog and cat interact until they are relaxed in the other person's presence.

### 2.5 There are realistic expectations. 

If your pet dog or cat has never lived with another pet before, it will temporarily not know how to deal with the situation. Besides, whether dogs view cats as pleasures, prey, or strange objects; Cats treat dogs as strange objects or dangers, all of which you cannot foresee until they actually meet. Just understand that this adaptation can take a long time and you will have the patience to help dogs and cats get along.

> Advice
- Try not to be biased. Sometimes wars happen because of jealousy. If the dog notices that the cat is getting more attention, it will behave in a negative way.
- It would be beneficial if animals were introduced to each other as a child. Small animals are more adaptable to the idea of ​​living with other species. However, the puppy is very playful and is not always aware of its strength, so it can accidentally injure the kitten. 
- Make sure you proceed slowly with the introduction, without placing the cat in front of the dog as soon as you pick it up. Make sure dogs and cats get used to each other before allowing them to share in an open space without your supervision.
- Sometimes, dogs and cats just can't get along. If this is the case, just separate them whenever possible and try to give your pet equal attention.

> Warning
- Don't leave pets alone together until they get along. Do not put one of your pets at risk of injury if you are not at home. It's easier and safer to keep your dog or cat in another room while you're away from home.
