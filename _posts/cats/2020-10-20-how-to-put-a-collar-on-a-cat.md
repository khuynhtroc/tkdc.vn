title: "How to put a collar on a cat?"
summary: Cat collars are great for cats that are kept free or kept outdoors, but as you may not be aware, collars can be helpful for cats that are kept indoors. If your cat is out on the street or runs away, the collar will prevent the cat from being mistaken for a stray cat and others can identify you as the cat's owner. Wearing a collar on your cat can be difficult, especially if this is your cat's first time wearing a collar. Be patient, the cat will get used to wearing a necklace, even forgetting the presence of the necklace.

## 1. Put a ring on your cat

### 1.1 Choose when to wear the bracelet.

Wearing a ring can be a refreshing experience for your cat, so it's important to choose a time when your cat is less resistant to it. Try wearing a strap while the cat is playing or eating, and the cat is distracted by another activity. You can also choose a time when the cat is calm, such as when you and the cat are quietly together.

### 1.2 Let the cat explore the bracelet.

Place the necklace on the ground near the cat so she can get used to it before it is worn on the neck. To make it more comfortable for your cat to wear it, you can make it a smelly cat. To do this, you can rub the bracelet against the cat's sleeping area. You can also rub a soft cloth against the cat's mouth (if the cat allows you to) and rub the cloth against the bracelet. cat is less likely to feel foreign to the bracelet if it detects its scent on it.
- You can also buy a synthetic pheromone spray at pet stores and spray it on the necklace.
- Don't force your cat to explore the necklace.

### 1.3 Put a collar on the cat's neck. 

When the cat is calm and in a good mood, slowly and gently put the collar on the cat's neck. Calm your cat in a gentle voice while wearing the ring so that he feels comfortable with the experience. Reward your cat with treats once the bracelet is on so that the cat can relate that to the wearing in a positive way.
- Your cat may get upset or scratch on the bracelet to remove it when it's first put on. 
- When you first put your cat on, leave the necklace on the cat's neck for a few minutes, and then remove it. 
- Wear a collar on your cat every day, letting the cat wear it a little longer each time. Cats may take some time before becoming comfortable wearing a bracelet all day.
- Consider giving your cat a treat every time the cat will put on a ring without trying to remove it. Eventually, your cat will get used to wearing a bracelet without being rewarded with food.
- If your cat takes off the bracelet on her own, put it back on but no more treats - otherwise, she may think she was rewarded for the removal of the bracelet.

### 1.4 Check to see if the bracelet fits. Make sure the necklace is neither too tight nor too wide for the cat. A bracelet is considered fitted if you can comfortably fit two to three fingers between the necklace and the cat's neck. cat will likely pull back when wearing the bracelet for the first time, so you may have to wait a few minutes until your cat loosens its neck muscles to check its width.

Do not pull or tug on the bracelet while inserting your finger.
- If the bracelet does not fit properly, remove it from the cat's neck, and adjust.

### 1.5 Check your cat's collar often. 

As an adult, a cat may gain or lose weight. As a result, changes in weight can cause the necklace to become too tight or too wide. If you find the bracelet becomes too wide or tightens against the cat's neck, remove it, and adjust accordingly.

## 2. Choose the right bracelet

### 2.1 Choose a safety bracelet. 

When you step into the pet store, you will find a variety of cat collars to choose from. However, keep in mind that safety is a prerequisite for all cat collars. A breakaway collar is the safest type for cats, as they will come off automatically if the cat accidentally loses the collar to something like curtains, furniture, and so on.
- The self-release collar has a latch that can open itself with enough pressure.
- Some rings have attachments, for example, bells. While such attachments are useful to a pet cat (warning prey for the presence of a cat, for example), they can be easily entangled, and that can be dangerous for cats.

### 2.2 Examine the bracelet. 

Before buying a bracelet, run your finger along with the bracelet. The collar should not be too rough or have sharp edges causing cat skin irritation. You should also check if the seams are not coming out. If the ring has pins, check that the edges are too sharp when the ring is attached. 
- Consider checking the latch's strength before leaving the store. Pull the ring with different traction. The latch will open automatically when there is moderate traction. If the bracelet detaches itself with only a weak pull, the cat will be able to pull off the ring easily. 
- The amount of force needed to let the bracelet off itself will depend on the cat's size and weight. For example, a heavy cat will need a latched ring that can withstand more force than a light cat.

### 2.3 Avoid buying elastic rings. 

Some cat collars will have a piece of elastic woven fabric that stretches just enough for the cat to get out of the ring if it gets stuck somewhere. However, these collars can seriously injure your cat if trapped in it. The elastic collar can also get stuck in your cat's jaw, causing serious injury.
- If you choose to buy a harp and it gets caught in your cat and causes injury, take the cat to the vet immediately for treatment. 

> Advice
- Add an identity tag to your cat's necklace.
- Make an extra necklace and a spare ID card. That way, if your cat removes the ring and you can't find the bracelet again, you still have a spare to use.
- If you have a cat indoors and want to take her out to play, don't put the leash on the cat's collar. If the cat pulls hard, the bracelet will slip off and the cat will run away. A cart strap is more secure when you take your cat out. It is sold at pet stores.
- It is more difficult to wear an adult cat collar than a kitten's collar. While it's easier to wear a collar on a kitten, a kitten is smaller and more flexible to escape from the necklace.
- If you have kittens, you will need to check the fit of the collar more often as the kittens grow very quickly.
- If your cat is constantly trying to remove the collar, even if you are sure that the collar is right, you may want to consider implanting cat tracking chips. A veterinarian can implant the chip directly under the cat's skin. This will make it easier for your cat to be identified if the cat is escaped or strayed.

> Warning
- A lice collar can contain chemicals that can irritate your cat's skin and cause hair loss. Talk to your veterinarian about giving your cat lice and tick vaccine.
- Don't use ribbons to make collars for cats. The ribbons can easily get caught on something, causing the cat to get strangled.
- Elastic collars can cause serious injuries.
