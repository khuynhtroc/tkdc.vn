### 1.1 Learn about grinding cylinders. 

Cats love to scratch a variety of materials including corrugated cardboard, carpeted surfaces, and cyan (a type of carpet). The grinding post is either vertical or horizontal, but cats generally prefer a standing post. Claw-grinding posts are also varied in shape and size. 
- Xidan is a popular claw sharpener for cats. Xidan is available from the carpet store; Alternatively, you can contact your veterinarian or pet store to find out where these mats are available.
- The claw-grinding post is ideal for stretching your cat's muscles. Although your cat prefers to use a standing post, a horizontal post can help stretch your cat while scratching.

### 1.2 Buy a sharpening cylinder. 

Given the wide variety of claw posts, it's worth buying a few to see what your cat likes. Remember that humans and cats have different concepts of ideal grinding columns. Therefore, you should allow them to decide which one to choose.
- If you buy a vertical claw grinding post, you should choose a pillar about 0.5 m high so that the cat can stretch its entire body while grinding. 
- Claw grinding posts need to stand firmly and firmly. If the post is unstable and falls over while the cat is scratching, it will no longer use it. If your cat prefers horizontal poles, be sure to fix it securely under the legs of the furniture so that it won't wobble while the cat uses it to sharpen its claws.

### 1.3 Do not dispose of the claw cylinder. 

After a period of use, the grinding cylinder often comes off and wears away. Even though you want to throw them away due to heavy damage, the cat finds that the wear is ideal for what they want.

### 2.1 Find out why the cat scratches.

### 2.2 Makes leather seats less attractive. 

While you can't stop scratching your cat, you will need to train your cat to be aware that leather chairs should not be used to sharpen claws. There are many things you can do to stop scratching your cat's leather chair from scratching.
- Sprinkle orange peels near the leather seats. Cats don't like the smell of this fruit.
- Dip a cotton ball in a solution that smells irritating to your cat (for example, perfume, or cream with a minty smell) and place it near the leather chair.
- Attach the material to the leather chair so that it is difficult for the cat to scratches, such as foil, glue, and sandpaper.
- Spray the cat with water (a small amount) when you see it scratching the chair. This will temporarily stop your cat from scratching, but when you're not around, the cat will continue to do this. This remedy has no lasting effect.
- Spray Feliway onto the chair. Feliway is a scented mist that keeps your cat away from areas you spray on. You can buy Feliway at your local pet store. 
- Deodorize your cat in a chair. Cats will scratch where their scent remains, so removing the cat's smell from the chair will prevent them from scratching. You can buy deodorant sprays at your local pet store.

### 2.3 Keep any cat-annoying things away from the fox. 

It can take weeks or months to stop your cat from scratching and scratching his leather seat. When your cat has less contact with leather seats, you can remove one. By the time you have cleaned it all up, the cat should already stop scratching the chair.

### 2.4 Do not punish your cat with spanking. 

While it can be frustrating to see a cat scratching a chair, the use of physical punishment doesn't help. Worse yet, this can only be counterproductive, as the cat will begin to bond you with the negativity. You should only spray the cat with water as much as possible to discourage her, but keep in mind that this is not a permanent remedy.

## 3. Encourage your cat to use a clawing post

### 3.1 Fix the position of the grinding cylinder. 

You should place the post in a position that the cat uses. It is better to put it where they scratch; If your cat is scratching a leather chair, you can place a pole nearby. You can also place scratching posts in the cat's living area, like a sleeping spot or a window they go to. If you place a pole in a corner of a room or a place where the cat rarely goes, they will not use the pole to scratch.
- Cats have a habit of scratching when they wake up, so place a pillar close to where you sleep to encourage use.

### 3.2 Oriented for cats. 

This means that while the cat is scratching the chair, you need to pick it up and switch to the grinding post. Cats take time to figure out why you moved them, and sometimes cats don't need to scratch on posts when you take them there. However, if your cat starts to use the abrading post, you can reward her with some treats.
- With positive reinforcement, your cat will learn to use a claw-grinding post instead of scratching a leather chair.

### 3.3 Makes the grinding cylinder attractive.

### 3.4 Feed your cat and play with them near the claw post. 

One good way to encourage your cat to use the claw post is to spend time playing with them near the claw post. The more fun you have with the claw-grinding post, the more your cat will enjoy using it.

### 3.4 Don't "teach" the cat how to scratch a pole. 

You may want to pick up their legs to show you how to use the claw post, but cats won't like this because they already know how to use their claws to scratch. You are trying to prevent them from scratching the leather seats, but you should still give them some space to learn how to use the grinding column.
- However, there are some ideas that it is advisable to place the cat's legs on the claw-grinding post to save the scent of the evidence, because the scent glands on the feet switch to the pillars, causing them to want to continue using the object.

> Advice
- Accept the fact that your cat often wants to scratch. You should not force them to give up an activity they enjoy and benefit them.
- If you can, orient scratching your cat when you are young. This is a time when you can easily correct your cat's behavior instead of waiting until it has grown up. If your cat is an adult, just give it time to learn how to scratch it in the right place.
- You can prune your cat's claws. Keep in mind that this is not effective in preventing the cat from scratching the chair, it will only minimize the damage the cat uses to scratch.
- You can use some products like Soft Paws to coat your cat's claws. Like the one above, this will ensure that the cat doesn't do too much damage when it comes to scratching. This is a great alternative if you don't have time to teach your cat how to use a clawing post.

> Warning
- Do not cut off your cat's claws. You need to be very aware of this! Amputation can be painful for cats and can have serious consequences. If you're not careful, you could injure the ligaments in the cat's paws, affecting her ability to walk normally. In addition, a cat whose nails have been cut off will not like using the litter box and may even develop a biting behavior. [32] If you are so upset that you intend to trim your cat's claws, consult your veterinarian about taking other measures.
