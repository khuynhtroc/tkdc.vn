### 1.1 Understand the most common behavior problems in cats. 

Although each cat has a unique personality and can have its own unique problems or bad behaviors, it generally manifests itself in seven ways:
- Avoid or refuse to use the toilet tray.
- Mark furniture and other items with your urine.
- Rake up appliances and other household objects. The cat can also scratch you or others while fighting.
- Be aggressive toward others, even toward their owners.
- Be aggressive toward other cats in your home.
- Show stress or anxiety.
- Show fear of objects or people.

### 1.2 Take the cat to the vet for a checkup. 

Sometimes cats respond with actions or display behavior problems because they are having health problems. For example, your cat may refuse to use the litter box because it has a urinary tract infection, or if your cat is aggressive because she's in pain somewhere you see it. Some cats may become afraid of people or things if they have vision problems; or, they may over-lick their hair if they have hyperthyroidism.
- Take your cat to the vet for a checkup to find any health problems that are causing your cat to show bad behavior and treat it promptly so that it doesn't get worse. If the vet has determined that the cat is perfectly healthy, you can focus on other environmental issues that may lead to poor behavior in the cat.

### 1.3 Recognize living conditions related to poor behavior in cats. 

Once you have determined that your cat does not have a health problem, you need to consider what causes your cat to exhibit one or more of the bad behaviors. Analyze the environmental causes of bad behavior in cats:
- The litter box is dirty or uncomfortable that the cat doesn't like to poop in the tray.
- The cat is being bullied by another cat in the house, leading to avoiding using the litter box and being aggressive.
- A newly adopted cat causes the cat to mark its territory with urine. A new dog in your home may also cause your cat to appear scared or aggressive.
- Lack of foundation rakes, leading to raking up furniture and other household items.

## 2. Modify bad behavior

### 2.1 Avoid verbal or dodgy punishment. 

Physical or emotional punishment is one of the most ineffective methods of correcting bad behavior. In fact, hitting or yelling at a cat can cause them to appear scared when around you, become shy, and show more aggressive scratching/biting. Your cat will continue to behave when you are not there, and over time it learns that it won't be punished for doing the bad deed out of your sight.
- Physical or emotional punishment is generally poor, does not prevent the cat from engaging in bad behavior, and is a short-term solution to the cat's problems. In addition, these reprimands create a more stressful atmosphere for you and your pets. While it is difficult not to hit or scold the cat when it is disturbing, such as when it marks urine on furniture or goes to the carpet instead of going to a separate litter box, it is important to keep the bottle. static like a master and try to apply other techniques more efficiently.

### 2.2 Apply remote adjustment. 

This technique associates an unpleasant surface, smell, smell, or sound with bad behavior to stop the cat from engaging in the behavior. You can use built-in items in your home to make remote adjustments, such as: 
- Surface: You can line sticky paper, aluminum foil, or anti-slip plastic carpeting over an area you don't want your cat to visit. Cats generally dislike walking on these surface textures.
- Smell: You can use scents that cats don't like in areas where you don't want them to enter. For example, place a cloth or cotton soaked with conditioner, perfume, room spray, citrus scent, aloe vera, eucalyptus oil, or blueberry oil on top of the object or surface to be confined. cat.
- Taste: You can rub certain foods on surfaces that your cat likes to chew or scratch on, such as bitter melon, citrus products, chili sauce, cayenne pepper, or aloe vera gel. Gradually, the cat will form a relationship between the "obnoxious" taste with the object and the surface and does not want to be in contact.
- Sound: Use startling noises to prevent them from engaging in bad behavior or walking on a surface. You can whistle, shake the bell, or shake a metal box with a few coins inside. Try using a sound instead of your voice to startle the cat the moment it is about to do something you don't think is good, and the cat will eventually associate the behavior with the annoying sound.

### 2.3 Ignore the cat when it starts to behave badly while playing together. 

If you notice that your cat is suddenly interested in playing in a rough or aggressive manner, try correcting the behavior by ignoring it.
- Do this by walking into another room and closing the door. Wait until the cat calms down, then touch or focus on it. Your cat will learn that bad behavior will make you angry during playtime and will stop doing so.

### 3.1 Keep the litter box clean. 

If your cat is acting away from the litter box, it is important to maintain the cleanliness of the tray to encourage her to use the litter box. This includes shoveling and changing sand/soil every day, cleaning the tray once a week, and making sure the litter box stays attractive to the cat. Most cats do not like to use the litter box with a lid or a carrying case because they are uncomfortable, so avoid using these trays. [7]
- If you have more than one cat, each one should have its own litter box and one more tray for planning. Try to place litter boxes all over the house so that each cat has enough space and privacy to use the toilet. Find a quiet area in your home where the cat can pee while looking around to see if anyone is walking behind you.
- Make sure the litter box is large enough for the cat to sit comfortably and has about 3-5 cm of space left in the tray. Cats generally do not like to go in a litter box that is too full of sand.

### 3.2 Provide scratching posts and daily playtime slots. 

Most cats exhibit bad things because they feel bored or motivated, so it's important to make a commitment to play with your partner. Use one or more toys to play with your cat to prevent him from playing roughly with your hand or arm. Focus your cat's attention on toys during playtime and swap out other toys each week so she won't get bored.
- Scratching posts are great at preventing cats from scratching furniture or fabric items in the home. Place scratching posts in shared indoor areas or cat favorite places.

### 3.3 Use pheromones in domestic cats to reduce stress. 

If your cat starts using urine to mark it or pee in the wrong place, the cat's synthetic pheromone will be very effective. This helps to relieve your cat from stress and prevents them from marking things with urine when feeling anxious or scared.
- This pheromone is usually sprayed with a diffuser or aerosol and is available at pet stores.
