## 1. Prepare before bedtime

### 1.1 Get your cat to be active during the day. 

A cat that is very active during the day will be sleepy at night. Let your cat play a lot in the morning and when you come home from work. Or you can let the catwalk around the block on a leash. You can leave a toy for your cat to play with, but don't use this as a substitute for bonding time.
- Interactive toys with snacks on the inside are also a fun option. Don't let your cat play with a leash when you are away, the cat may choke.
- It is perfectly normal for adult cats to sleep up to 16 hours a day, and older cats need even more sleep. Allow your cat to snooze during the day as long as she has enough exercise.

### 1.2 Plan to have fun right before bed. 

Establish a habit of playing for at least 10 minutes at night. This will tire the cat, and if done regularly, the cat will understand that it is a sign that it is time to go to bed. Start with active play, then gradually decrease your intensity in the last minutes.
- Are you raising a lively kitten? Direct its attention to a snack when you need to stop playing.
- Older cats also benefit from play, even if you need to convince them a little. Use soft and slow-moving toys.

### 1.3 Feed your cat before bedtime.

Most cats will fall asleep after they have eaten a full meal, so help your cat sleep well by feeding it right before bedtime.

### 1.4 Place a shelf near the bed. 

Cats love tall, warm shelves so they can see the room. If necessary, you can use food to lure your cat to sit on it when you go to bed. This way, the cat will be comfortable with your nighttime routine, and it won't be long before the cat will jump into bed with you.
- If your cat has its own bed or likes to sleep on a specific object, move that item on a shelf. Cats are usually quite picky about where they sleep, so your arrangement may not be right for your cat, but you should still give it a try.

### 1.5 Let the cat explore the bed. 

Your cat may prefer the bed if you leave it alone. Lure the cat up there with a treat or catmint if that's what your cat likes. Praise your cat and add treats if she stays in bed, but don't get angry or force her to come back if she leaves. Your cat will be more likely to do what you want if it doesn't associate your bed with negative activities.

### 1.6 New bedding. 

Some cats like to be clean and only sleep on a cleaned blanket.  Many other cats love the smell of their owner. If you keep the bedding "excessively" clean, put a garment in bed so the cat can play with or hide in it.

### 1.7 Reward your cat if he sleeps with you overnight. 

Some cats do not like to sleep in the bed but still explore the place during the night. If so is your cat, you can reward cat food every time it appears. Hide the food under your pillow or in your pajamas pocket to let your cat find it on his own, so you won't have to wake up to give your cat a treat. Once your cat is ready to climb into bed with you, gradually reduce the amount of junk food your cat has until he returns to a healthy diet:
- Consistency is the key first. Make sure your cat gets a treat every night. (As long as you don't feed your cat any more when it pokes or squeals, you won't be able to sleep.)
- Once in the habit, you can feed your cat 3/4 of the time. On other nights, reward your cat by scratching its head or another enjoyable activity.
- Gradually reduce the frequency of snacking to every other day, then every three days ... until it becomes a rare reward.

## 2. Sleep with your cat all night

### 2.1 Correct your cat's inappropriate behavior in bed. 

When you turn the lights off and your cat has jumped into bed, you may think that you will be able to sleep well together. However, cats are very playful at night, even when they play a lot before going to bed. They may play with your face, sit on your head, or call for attention. It is important that you strengthen your master's status by correcting the cat's behavior immediately.
- That might mean picking up the cat and putting it aside and saying "no". Or you can place your cat in the corner of the room by placing her bed or sleeping box there. If your cat starts playing while you are asleep, say “no” and point to her bed. Go on just until it comes out and leaves you alone.

### 2.2 Don't reward your cat when he wakes you up. 

If your cat wakes you up at any time, including in the morning, don't feed, play, or react to you - whether it's yelling or chasing away. These responses will make your cat understand that waking you up is an effective way to get attention. Instead, get out of bed when you want and spend at least 15 minutes doing something else before feeding your cat. You may have to put a pillow in your ear for a few mornings when the cat is howling, but most cats will forget it immediately if you remain steadfast.
- An auto-feeder can be the perfect solution for this situation, especially if the cat has gotten used to eating as soon as you wake up. You can set the cat food dispenser every morning, or two to three times during the night if your cat asks for food.

### 2.3 Identify noisy or distracting behaviors during the night. 

If your cat wakes you up by running or chirping at night, seek immediate solutions. If the behavior comes on suddenly, get your cat for a checkup. Even if you think your cat is healthy, a quick fix can help prevent bad behavior from becoming inherent.
- A kitten that runs around during the night may need more play during the day, ideally with another cat. If your new cat is very vocal and does not want to nuzzle you, put a ticking clock in the blanket with a moderate hot water bottle.
- Most cats older than 10 years old have less sensitive senses and weaker mentality, and as a result, they sleep less. Getting regular exercise during the day can keep your cat tired enough to sleep straight through the night. If your cat is grumbling or scratching the floor, it may be disoriented or frightened by vision impairment. Install a night light between your bed and the cat's litter box.

### 2.4 Seek your cat if she doesn't stop crying. 

If your cat is active all night or screams frequently, it is likely under stress or in pain due to illness. Have your cat examined and discussed with your doctor about the current situation.

> Advice
- If you have persuaded your cat to go to bed with, but find it difficult to fall asleep, it may be best to move the cat to another room. The longer you let this persist, the more your cat will screech and scratch the door to get in with you. Placing double-sided tape, aluminum foil, or a special cat repellent mat in front of your room can stop your cat from doing these behaviors.
