## 1. Provide clean water

### 1.1 Prepare a variety of bowls and cups. 

Cats can be quite picky and prefer only one type of bowl or cup. They may prefer stainless steel, regular porcelain, or plastic bowls or cups. To know what your cat likes, you should come up with a variety of styles to choose from.
- You can also test the depth of the bowl. Cats may only like deep or shallow bowls. These are just their own preferences.

### 1.2 Place a bowl of water around the house. 

Don't just put the bowl in one place, as your cat may not be able to drink. Instead, place the bowl near the tub, on the kitchen counter, near your bed, in the bathroom, or around the house. This will encourage your cat to explore and remind her to drink. 
- You should place the water bowl in the cat's living areas. For example, if the cat sleeps on the windowsill a lot, you can place a cup of water next to the area.
- You can also place the bowl near the tub to see if your cat is interested.

### 1.3 Keep the bowl and water clean. 

You can wash the dishes with soap and water every two days, making sure to rinse them thoroughly with water. Once a week, you should put the bowl in the dishwasher to sterilize it. Change the water at least once or twice a day and regularly check to see if anything has gotten inside the water bowl, especially when you place the bowl near the kitchen. 
- Your cat may not drink a lot of water if the bowl is not clean. Some cats are very difficult to only drink clean water and will show a picky nature by refusing to drink.

### 1.4 Pay attention to where your cat is drinking. 

The water bowl should be in an attractive location away from your cat's food bowl or litter box. Although some do not care if the water bowl is near the toilet tray or the food bowl, others want their food and toilet near the water.
- Make it easier for your cat to see you moving the water to a new area away from food or litter boxes. This way, they will not feel fear once the water is taken away.

### 1.5 Turn on the tap. 

Although this is not necessarily the most effective way to save water, some cats prefer to drink tap water. Cats can be quite excited and curious at the sight of movement and want to drink water. If they aren't excited at first, hold the cat up in the tub and show them how fun it is to drink tap water.
- No one wants to let the water run continuously, so you should only do it in the morning or at night so that the cat can catch a fixed time of drinking.

### 1.6 Consider using a fountain. 

If your cat likes running water, you can buy a fountain. This device maintains the flow of water throughout the day, making drinking water more attractive. Your cat may enjoy watching, playing, and drinking in the fountain. You should not dispose of regular water bottles when providing fountains. Have two things ready for your cat to decide on.
- Fountains for cats are often high priced, mostly over 1 million VND. However, if you are concerned about your cat becoming dehydrated, this is a worthwhile investment.

## 2. Encourage your cat to drink water

### 2.1 Add flavor to the water. 

Fill your cat's water with tuna or chicken broth. You can also add more water to moist cat food. Just a teaspoon or two of the flavor mixed with the water is enough to attract your cat to drink, especially if he likes to eat wet food. Note, however, that not all cats love flavored drinks.
- You can also encourage your cat to drink water by crushing mint leaves in a bowl of water. You can let your cat see you crushing catmint leaves in the water so they know that their favorite leaf is in the bowl.

### 2.2 Provide bottled water. 

Buy bottled water and see if your cat prefers tap water. They may not like tap water due to excess chlorine and minerals.
- Provide both warm bottled water and cool water at the same time to see which one your cat likes to drink.

### 2.3 Give your cat plenty of moist foods. 

The source of moist food is abundant and expensive, but it has a higher moisture content than dry food. If you are concerned about your cat not getting enough water, switch to completely moist food or replace your cat's daily dry food occasionally. You should consult your doctor before changing the food.
Do not pour water into your cat's dry food to get her to drink. Not only does this make the food less attractive and soaked, but spoil it, affecting the cat's health.

### 2.4 Add ice cubes to the water. 

Some cats are very fond of cold water and ice acts as toys for them. At first, add only one or two ice cubes to the bowl. This will prevent your cat from being shocked by the change in temperature. If your cat likes the taste, freeze the broth to ice and place it in a bowl.
You can have your cat watch for ice in the water. Then they will be very excited and mentally motivated to drink.

### 2.5 Feed your cat small meals often. 

Many cats tend to drink after eating, just like humans, so you should feed your cat more than once or twice a day. Divide meals into small portions to encourage them to drink regularly throughout the day. Your cat usually takes a long time to adjust to a new feeding schedule, but this will help her stay hydrated at all times.
- If you want to feed regularly, you must always schedule a time to do it.

> Advice
-If the water can freeze, use a stainless steel plate instead of a glass bowl. In the event of a power supply nearby, use a bowl of water that can heal itself. Many bowls are made of plastic, but the inside is lined with separate stainless steel. Fill the stainless steel bowl with water to conduct heat into the water source.

> Warning
- Drinking fluids and urinating a lot can be warning signs of serious illness. Cats with these symptoms need to be thoroughly examined by a veterinarian. Likewise, if your cat has stopped drinking water completely, you should also seek medical attention.
