## 1.	Creating the Nurturing Environment

### 1.1. Learn how to hold a kitte

Always wash your hands before and after holding a kitten. They can carry disease or become susceptible to infections and bacteria on the skin. When holding a kitten, you need to be extra careful. Always make sure the kitten's body is warm by observing whether the pads are cold under the feet. Chances are they will start to sound when they feel cold.
- If you have other pets in your home, be sure to separate them from the orphan kittens for at least 2 weeks. Do not let them share toiletries, food, or water bowls, as this can spread illnesses to them.

### 1.2. Keep the kitten warm

Newborn kittens (under 2 weeks of age) do not have the ability to regulate their own body temperature and often keep warm by snuggling against the mother. Since they don't have a mother around, it's a good idea to put a hot pad designed for dogs or kittens. Place the cat on the heater base, avoiding direct contact with the gasket without the fur on it. If there is no hair cover, wrap a towel around the pad.
- Kittens should not be exposed to the heating pad directly, as they can result in local burns or heat shock.
- You can also use a hot water bottle wrapped with a towel but check it regularly to maintain heat (about 37 degrees Celsius).

### 1.3. Cat nest design

Place the box or cat carrier in a quiet, isolated area of the house. The location should be warm and airtight, away from other pets. Place a towel inside the box to give the kitten a cozy rest. You should also lay a towel over the box or cage to keep warm.
- Do not cover the vents in the box or cage to prevent the kitten from choking.

### 1.4. Put all newborn kittens in one place

You do not need to separate them into separate boxes. Keep them together to keep them warm and comfortable. The box or cage should have enough space for the kitten to move around.
- For example, a kitten may move to the edge of the hot pad if it feels too hot.

## 2.	Feed the Kittens

### 2.1. Buy cat milk powder instead

You can choose a brand like Cimicat from a veterinary clinic, a major pet store, or on the internet. This is a formula for newborn cats, with the same ingredients as the mother's milk. Do not give cow's milk to your cat because sugar, or lactose, can upset the kitten's stomach.
- If a milk substitute is not available and the kitten is hungry, give him a temporary drink of cool, boiled water. Use a dropper or syringe, until you get replacement milk at your vet or pet store. Water prevents the kitten from becoming dehydrated and does not upset their stomach.

### 2.2. Prepare the kitten to feed

Sterilize bottles and nipples with boiling water, then let cool completely on a clean towel. Mix the milk replacement recipe with a whisk to beat the dough. You need to warm up the milk to 35-37 degrees C before feeding a kitten. At the last step, you should put a few drops under your wrist to make sure the mixture is not too hot.
- Always keep the kitten warm before feeding it. Kittens should not be fed when their body temperature is lower than 35 degrees Celsius, as this can cause pneumonia, making it difficult for cats to breathe and even death.

### 2.3. Keep the kitten and bottle in place while feeding

Do not hold the cat and breastfeed like a baby. Instead, keep her legs down and head straight as if they were feeding the mother cat's milk. Hold the nape and place the nipple on the side, then push it out into the center of the cat's mouth. The kitten will then adjust to its comfortable nipple. You should let your cat suckle from the bottle. Do not spray or put in their mouths.
- Stimulate your kitten to burp after eating. This step is the same as with a baby. Hold the kitten over her chest, thigh, or shoulder and gently rub and then pat her back with 2 fingers until the kitten is gone.
- If the kitten can't grip you on its own, keep your face still and not let the kitten move its head. Feed the kitten again and drain a few drops of milk. Then they will fix themselves.

### 2.4. Feed the kitten often

A hungry kitten will scream and wiggle as if looking for a nipple to feed on. Feed them every 2-3 hours for the first 2 weeks. You should use a bottle with a teat specifically designed for cats (manufactured by Catch). Follow the instructions on the milk substitute packaging to determine how much to take with each meal. Kittens, when they are fully fed, will fall asleep while breastfeeding and have a round belly
- In an emergency, you will need to use a dropper bottle or small syringe to drip the milk into the kitten's mouth.
- After 2 weeks, you can feed them 3-4 hours apart, and 6 hours at night.

## 3.	Take care of Kittens

![Care-for-Orphaned-Kittens-Less-Than-Three-Weeks-of-Age-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-take-care-of-an-orphan-kittens-younger-than-three-weeks-old/v4-728px-Care-for-Orphaned-Kittens-Less-Than-Three-Weeks-of-Age-Step-9-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.1. Help the kitten go to the toilet

Usually, the mother cat licks her kitten's genitals after each feeding to stimulate her to urinate and defecate. Before and after each feed, you need to wipe the bottom of the kitten with a cotton pad soaked in warm water. This step encourages them to go to the toilet, as they cannot do it on their own until a few weeks of age. Place the kitten on a clean blanket and turn it over on its side. Use a damp cotton pad to rub your genitals in one direction, don't back and forth because it can cause friction. You will notice that the kitten has begun to pee or defecate. Continue rubbing until they stop going to the toilet.
- Kittens' urine is odorless and light yellow in color. The stool is yellow-brown. If you notice white or green stools, or dark urine with a strong smell, then the kitten may become dehydrated or need medical attention.

### 3.2. Wipe the kitten clean. After feeding the kitten and helping her poop, you need to clean the kitten. Take a warm damp cloth and gently wipe the bristles. Then blot dry completely and place them inside the bo

- If you notice dry feces getting on the kitten's fur, gently soak her bottom in warm water. Then carefully wipe off the loose stool with a cloth.

### 3.3. Check the kitten's weight

Kittens should gain weight steadily during the first few months. You need to check their weight at the same time each day and record their numbers. Kittens usually increase their weight twice a week after birth. They should continue to gain 15 grams per day after the first week. If your kitten stops gaining weight or loses weight, he or she may have a problem and need to see your vet.
- For example, newborn cats usually weigh 90-110 grams. About 2 weeks old, the kitten will reach a weight of about 210 grams. After 3 weeks of age, their weight will be 300 grams.

### 3.4. Know when to take your kitten to the vet

See your veterinarian as soon as possible so they can check for dehydration, worms, and parasites, and evaluate the kitten's health. Some veterinarians' offices offer a free checkup in case you are caring for a rescued kitten. You should also know when to take them to the vet for treatment. Seek medical attention if you have any of the following:
- High or low body temperature (above 39 degrees C or below 37 degrees C)
- Anorexia (if the kittens stop eating one day, they need urgent medical attention)
- Vomiting (if the condition persists, they need urgent medical attention)
- Lost weight
- Cough, sneezing, and discharge from the eyes and nose
- Diarrhea (if the condition persists, they need urgent medical attention)
- Lack of energy
- Bleeding (urgent medical attention)
- Shortness of breath (emergency medical attention)
- Injury, like being hit by a car, falling, limping, being stepped on, unconscious (urgent medical attention)

> Advice:
- Many cities hold cat sterilization programs.
- The zoological farm is ideal for inexpensive veterinary advice and care and can help you find a home for your kittens when they are old enough. Some farms have volunteers to keep cats until they are old enough to be adopted.
- The best place for a newborn cat is to be with the mother cat. A feral cat should stay with its mother until it is 4 weeks old, if possible. Observe carefully to see if they are orphaned or abandoned before starting to cultivate. Sometimes the mother does not go far from her nest. Abandoned kittens will become dirty and scream continuously from the cold and hunger.
- If you find a litter of newborn cats that is orphaned and cannot provide the necessary services or know someone for help, you should take them to your local Humane Organization or zoological camp as soon as possible. A humanitarian or zoological organization that specializes in caring for orphan kittens if you cannot afford to keep them.
- If you only have one cat, you can place a small stuffed animal by the side so it cuddles and reminiscent of the mother cat and its siblings.
- Use a toothbrush to simulate the roughness of the cat's mother's tongue after the kitten has finished breastfeeding. Place the ticking clock near the cat's nest to comfort them and make them feel more secure.
- Let the kittens hide and do not force it. They will gradually open up to you more. Grab the large box and place the nest inside so the kitten feels safe.

> Warning
- Even with the best care, kittens can die from not being raised by the mother cat.
