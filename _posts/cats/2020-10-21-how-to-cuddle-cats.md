## 1. Focus on Areas with Scent Glands

### 1.1 Start gently scratching your chin. 

Use your finger or fingernail to gently rub the cat's chin, especially where the jawbone connects to the skull. The cat may rub your hand or extend its chin forward, both of which are signs that the cat is feeling good.

### 1.2 Focus on the area between or behind the ear. 

Use your fingers and use gentle force. The ear is the part that marks the cat's smell.
- If your cat is rubbing your head on you (called "huc"), they are releasing a scent to mark you in their possession.

### 1.3 Caress the cheekbones behind the mustache.

If your cat likes this, he or she will turn its cheekbones forward to ask for more cuddling.

### 1.4 Gently run the back of your hand along the side of your face. 

Once the cat has been warmed up, you can use your middle finger to stroke the cat's "mustache" (on the upper lip) while gently brushing around the cat's entire face and stroking the top of the cat's head with your thumb. The cat is now yours.

### 1.5 Pet the cat from forehead to tail. 

Swipe the cat's forehead, then drag down the base of the tail in a continuous direction from head to tail. Massage the cat's neck muscles by gently pinching. Use gentle force and do continuous, slow motion. You should only claw in a fixed direction (from forehead to tail), as cats don't like to claw in the opposite direction.
- Do not touch the tailor move the hand along the side.
- If your cat likes your petting, he will bend his back against your hand. When you pull your hand away, the cat may rub her forehead against your hand to encourage you to continue cuddling. If the cat folds its ears, curls up, or goes away, stop petting them.
- You can gently scratch as you move your hand around the cat's back but don't just scratch one spot. You should move your hand from head to tail.
- Use light pressure on the tail, but be careful. This is a concentrated area for scent glands, and some cats like you to scratch it. However, some have a habit of suddenly biting your hand when they're satisfied.

## 2. Let the Cat Proactively Approach

### 2.1 Let your cat sniff it before you cuddle it to make it comfortable. 

Extend your hand or fingers and let the cat touch your nose with your body.
- If your cat is disinterested in her hands or just staring suspiciously, reconsider your intention to petting. Choose a different time when the cat is in a happier mood.
- If your cat sniffs your hand, purrs, then rubs her chin or head against yours, or rubs her body against you, this is a sign she wants to be cuddled. Open your palms and gently touch their body.

### 2.2 Wait until the cat rubs your head. 

This is the signal they want to be noticed. If you are busy with work, you should pet the cat once or twice, letting them know that you are not ignoring them.

![Pet-a-Cat-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-cuddle-cats/v4-728px-Pet-a-Cat-Step-8-Version-6.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Cuddle your cat as it jumps in your lap and curls up. 

Watch to see if they stir. If so, this may mean that the cat just wants to lie there and relax, since humans have a warm body temperature that makes them feel comfortable. If the cat does not budge, you can continue gently stroking the spine or points described in section 2.

### 2.4 Cuddle your cat while she is standing beside him. 

Cats love to be loved when they are with their owners. You can gently stroke the upper body. If your cat meows or purrs, the cat is feeling good.
- However, you should avoid touching the cat's belly.

### 2.5 Understand cat communication. 

Cats often make a low (purring) sound. Purring is one of the ways a cat signals that it feels close and wants attention. When it comes to hips touching, rolling back and forth around your ankles, or rubbing your head, this means your cat wants you to cuddle right now. Sometimes cats only need gentle petting, such as shaking hands or greeting, rather than a long hug and pulling closer.
- The loudness of a cat's purr is indicative of how much pleasure it is. The louder your cat is, the happier he will be. A small purr is a signal of satisfaction, while a loud purr means a cat is very happy. Excessive shouting represents extreme excitement which can sometimes turn into discomfort. Therefore you should be careful.

### 2.6 Watch for signs that the cat no longer wants to be petted.

Sometimes cuddling can become overly stimulating or uncomfortable, especially if the action is repeated over and over again. If you don't pay attention, the cat will signal by biting or scratching. However, a cat usually gives a small signal before biting that it does not want to be petted. You need to heed these caveats to stop petting at the appropriate time:
- Ears flat on the head
- Tail twitching
- Stirring
- Growling or hissing

## 3. Know What to Avoid

![Pet-a-Cat-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-cuddle-cats/v4-728px-Pet-a-Cat-Step-12-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Swipe the cat's fur from head to tail and do not change direction.

Some cats do not like being petted from tail to head.

![Pet-a-Cat-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-cuddle-cats/v4-728px-Pet-a-Cat-Step-13-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Do not pat the cat. 

Some cats like this, others don't, and if you're not used to being with them, don't try this if you don't want to be bitten or scratched by your cat.

![Pet-a-Cat-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-cuddle-cats/v4-728px-Pet-a-Cat-Step-14-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Stay away from the abdomen. 

When your cat is relaxing, she can lie on her back with her stomach open. Don't assume this means that your cat likes to be petted, as most cats don't like this at all. This is because in nature cats must always protect themselves from dangerous predators (as opposed to dogs because they are more confident in this matter - and prefer to be petted). The abdomen is a vulnerable area containing all the internal organs, so the cat will show her fangs and raise claws if you touch this sensitive part.
- Some cats like to be petted, but they see this as playing with strength or grappling and scratching with their claws. They will pull their claws around your hand or arm, bite your hand, and scratch vigorously with your front and back legs. This does not attack but how they play "wrestling".
- If the cat grabs you with your paw, hold it still and let it pull back on its claws. If necessary, use your other hand and gently push the cat's paw so that the claw is hidden inward. Cats will often accidentally scratch deeper if the claw becomes trapped. They use claws to hold and grip, so if the cat signals you to stop moving your hands, they will stop if you do too.

![Pet-a-Cat-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-cuddle-cats/v4-728px-Pet-a-Cat-Step-15-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Carefully approach the cat's paws. You should never touch their paws unless you are close to the cat and know that he likes to play with his feet. Start petting the cat to relax it, then ask permission to stroke the cat's paw by touching one of the paws with your finger.

Many cats don't like touching their paws, but can be trained to do some activities like slow, continuous, and encouraging pedicure.
- If the cat does not object, use your fingers to gently stroke the paws in the direction of the hair growth (from the ankle to the toes). When the cat pulls its paw, hisses, folds his ears, or walks away, stop petting it.

> Advice
- If the cat flicks its tail up or down or sideways, stop cuddling the cat as it may be agitated.
- If your cat sees you as a stranger, be patient. The things their close owners do are acceptable, but they won't get used to when strangers do so.
- If your cat hits you in the hand, don't panic. They just want to have fun!
- Some cats like to be held, while others do not. If the cat tries to jump out of your hand, this is a sign it doesn't want to be touched.
- Cats love to gently scratch their cheeks. Others like you to gently touch their nose with your little finger.
- Know when your cat likes to be petted and when he doesn't like the owner to poke or scratch lightly.
- You can swipe behind the cat's ear or under the chin. Those are the right areas for cuddling
- If you see a cat whipping its tail vigorously, its ears moving back and forth, pupil widening, or feet stretched up, stop petting the cat, as it is being irritated and may bite or scratch its owner!
- Some cats like you to rub your ears. If you gently massage the folds of the ear they will feel relaxed. However, you should be careful because some cats do not like this.
- Approach the cat slowly and bend over low. Most cats don't like the owner to be too tall for them.
- Many cats don't like tails, so avoid this!
- Cuddling your cat releases relaxation hormones that reduce stress, lower blood pressure, and reduce your risk of heart disease or stroke. 

> Warning
- Children need close supervision when petting cats. Children can easily provoke the cat to bite or scratch. An adult-friendly cat doesn't always get along with children. Absolutely do not let small children come face to the cat.
- If you are injured by a cat bite or scratch, wash the wound with antibacterial soap and apply an antiseptic. Then seek medical help. A deep perforated wound requires medical attention because the risk of infection is very high.
- Do not cuddle your cat if you are allergic.
- If you find your cat is aggressive, stay away as it can hurt by biting and scratching.
- Don't pet the cat if it feels uncomfortable.
