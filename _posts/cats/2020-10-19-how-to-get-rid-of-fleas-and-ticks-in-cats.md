## 1. Identify and kill fleas in cats

![Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-1]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-and-ticks-in-cats/v4-728px-Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-1-Version-3.jpg.webp)!

### 1.1 Learn about the shape of the flea. 

Most people think fleas are tiny creatures, but if you look closely you will see them with the naked eye without a magnifying glass. Adult fleas are very small in size, less than 3 mm long. They are reddish-brown insects, and although they have no wings, they can jump very high.
- The flea's body is flattened on both sides, so the distance from the back to the abdomen is greater than the side to side.

![Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-2]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-and-ticks-in-cats/v4-728px-Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-2-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 1.2 Look for flea signs in your cat. 

Use a thick brush to brush the cat's fur from back to front. Observe the cat's skin for fleas. Fleas have to bite to suck blood, so their bites leave a red, torn skin on the cat's skin. You should also look for waste, also called flea feces. When you've finished brushing your cat, shake the comb so that the scales and dirt are spilled on a white paper towel moistened with water. The flea's waste will be reddish-brown since it's digested blood. This is another sign that your cat has fleas.
- If you are not sure if your cat has fleas, take the cat to the vet. Your veterinarian can identify and prescribe it to help eradicate this parasite.
- Check your cat carefully if he has been outside or has been to places where fleas may be infected (dog and cat care facilities, dog care, friends' homes, hotels, etc.)

### 1.3 Talk to your veterinarian about flea medicine. 

Your doctor can help you choose safe and effective products. You should also buy flea medicine from your veterinarian, as some of the medications sold at pet stores can be dangerous for cats. There are "topical" and oral products for treating fleas.
- Tell your vet if you have children or pregnant women in your home. This is the key factor in determining the safest treatment for both you and your pet.

![Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-4]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-and-ticks-in-cats/v4-728px-Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-4-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 1.4 Choose a topical medication. 

You will have many options when looking for flea medication for your cat. There are many monthly treatments that should be used year-round as a preventive measure. Make sure the product you choose is for cats, not dogs. Cats can get very sick (even die) if they are treated with a flea medicine intended for dogs. A “spot” treatment is applied directly to the cat's skin to quickly kill the flea. Some of the medications used to treat fleas include: 
- Dinotefuran and pyriproxyfen (known as Vectra): This product kills only fleas. Make sure not to choose the wrong product with a similar name, Vectra 3D, a dog product. Vectra 3D contains permethrin, which is harmful to cats.
- Fipronil and (S) -methoprene (known as Frontline Plus for Cats): This product kills larvae, eggs, and adult fleas. It also kills ticks and lice.
- Imidacloprid and pyriproxyfen (known as Advantage II): This product kills fleas at all stages of their life cycle. Be sure not to choose the wrong product with a similar name, Advantix II, which is a dog product. Advantix II contains permethrin that is toxic to cats. 
- Selamectin (known as Revolution): Apply this medication once a month to kill adult fleas and eggs. The product also kills ticks, filariasis, ear lice, and scabies. Note that Selamectin is not licensed as a tick product. It is only partially effective against certain ticks and ineffective against Ixodes ticks, which carry Lyme disease. If ticks are the main problem then talk to your doctor about more effective methods of control such as a Seresto collar or Frontline.

### 1.5 Consider taking an oral flea medicine for your cat. 

If you just need to kill the fleas and not the ticks, you can consider giving your cat the medicine in suspension or tablet form. Oral products usually act quickly and leave no residue on your cat's fur. These drugs can only be purchased from a veterinarian. Your cat can also recommend the best product for your cat. Many of these monthly drugs need to be used year-round as a preventive measure. These medications may include: 
- Lufenuron (known as Program): This medication comes in the form of tablets or oral suspension or injection. Give your cat a pill once a month with food to kill flea eggs and larvae.
- Nitenpyram (known as Capstar): This medication comes in an oral tablet form. Give your cat medication as directed by your veterinarian to kill adult fleas and eggs.
- Spinosad (also known as Comfortis): This medicine comes in a chewable form, and should be given to your cat with food once a month to kill fleas.

### 1.6 Use medication correctly. 

In general, you will need to hold the bottle upright to prevent spills and open according to the instructions. Line the fur on the cat's neck (just below the skull or between the shoulder blades) to reveal the skin. This way, the cat will not be able to lick the medication while grooming. Turn the bottle upside down and squeeze all of the medication into one spot on the cat's skin. Make sure the medication is absorbed into the skin, not just the hair. Check the medicine bottle to make sure it is empty.
- Always read the label carefully for the correct use, as each medicine can be used differently.

## 2. Identify and kill ticks in cats

![Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-and-ticks-in-cats/v4-728px-Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-7-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Learn about tick shapes. 

Although many tick species have different characteristics, most ticks have oval bodies and small heads. They are usually reddish-brown, dark brown, black, or gray. Usually, ticks are no more than 6 mm long, some types may be smaller. Note that the female tick can significantly increase in size by 12 mm when fully drained. 
- Unlike fleas, ticks are not insects. They are arachnoid, like spiders, so adult ticks have 8 legs. The young or youngest (larvae) has 6 legs.

![Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-and-ticks-in-cats/v4-728px-Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-8-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Look for tick signs in your cat. 

Ticks cannot fly or jump, so they often crawl on the host's body. When you bite your cat, the tick will attach firmly to the cat's skin until the blood is absorbed. You cannot see the tick's head while it is sucking blood, so it is difficult to see if you have seen the tick or if you see a dark, lumpy skin nodule on the cat's skin. To tell the difference, look at the tick's legs. Ticks also often gather in warm, closed parts of the body, such as between the toenails, in the ears, and under the armpits. However, you can find them anywhere on your cat's body. 
- If you are not sure if the bug is a tick, you can put it in a sealed plastic bag and take it to your vet.
- Check the cat thoroughly if it has been outside or in places where it may be contaminated (tall grass, barn, farm, etc.)

![Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-and-ticks-in-cats/v4-728px-Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-9-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Get rid of ticks properly. 

If you see a tick-like object in your cat, make sure it's a tick. Look at the paw to make sure it's a tick and not a nodule on the cat's skin. If it is a tick, put on gloves and use the small tweezers to grip the tick, as close to the skin as possible. Pull out slowly, taking care not to twist your hand. You need to end the cicadas following you. Otherwise, the tip can cause infection. Place the tick in a small alcoholic container to kill and store the tick if you want to show it to your veterinarian.
- You should check your cat daily from head to tail for ticks if it is showing signs of a tick infection or your cat has just visited areas where ticks may be present (such as tall grasslands).

![Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-and-ticks-in-cats/v4-728px-Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-10-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 Talk to your doctor about a tick medicine. 

Your doctor will help you choose safe and effective products. You should also buy medications directly from your veterinarian, as some medications sold at pet stores can be dangerous for cats. “Topical” medications can kill fleas and ticks, but there are no oral medications that can kill ticks. 
- Tell your vet if you have children or pregnant women in your home. This is an important factor in determining the safest treatment for both you and your pet.

![Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-and-ticks-in-cats/v4-728px-Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-11-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.5 Choose a topical medication. 

You have many options when looking for a tick medication for your cat. There are several monthly treatments that should be used year-round as a preventive measure. Make sure the product you choose is for cats, not dogs. Cats can get very sick (even die) if they are treated with a tick medicine intended for dogs. A “spot” treatment is applied directly to the cat's skin to quickly kill the flea. Some anti-tick drugs include: 
- Fipronil and (S) -methoprene (known as Frontline Plus for Cats): Apply this medication once a month to kill larvae, eggs, and adult fleas. It also kills ticks and lice.
- Selamectin (known as Revolution): Apply this medication once a month to kill adult fleas and eggs. This product can also kill ticks, filariasis, ear lice, and scabies. Note that Selamectin is not licensed as a tick product. It is only partially effective against certain ticks and ineffective against Ixodes ticks, which carry Lyme disease.

### 2.6 Use medication correctly. 

In general, you will need to hold the bottle upright to prevent spills and open according to the instructions. Line the fur on the cat's neck (just below the skull or between the shoulder blades) to reveal the skin. This way, the cat will not be able to lick the medication while grooming. Turn the bottle upside down and squeeze all of the medication into one spot on the cat's skin. Make sure the medication is absorbed into the skin, not just the hair. Check the medicine bottle to make sure it is empty.
- Always read the label carefully for the correct use, as each medicine can be used differently.

### 2.7 Ask your veterinarian about other options for tick control. 

Your doctor can recommend other ways to avoid ticks in your cat. A popular option is the Bayer manufacturer's Seresto necklace. This necklace can be used for kittens older than 10 weeks and adult cats. Serest collars can eliminate ticks within 8 months.
- There are also tick kill collars with other brands. Check with your veterinarian to find out which one is right for your cat.

## 3. Eliminate fleas and ticks from your yard

![Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-and-ticks-in-cats/v4-728px-Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-14-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Lawns need to be trimmed and kept dry for tick control to be effective. 

Ticks grow well in damp, shady areas and in tall lawns. Cut the lawn regularly to prevent it from spreading into your yard. You should also trim low shrubs and remove any dead leaves. This helps to remove shady and damp areas in the yard - tick and flea favorite places. 
- Making the environment (home yard) no longer a good shelter for ticks and fleas is crucial to prevent them from attaching to your pet.
- Compost piles should be kept away from homes and outdoor play areas such as sandy yards and wooden floors.

![Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-and-ticks-in-cats/v4-728px-Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-15-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Create a barrier against ticks. 

Ticks do not like to cross paths lined with shavings, mulch, or gravel. Spread these materials around your yard to prevent ticks from entering your yard and home. The barrier should be about 1 meter wide.
- Do not place piles of wood along with the house; instead, leave it outside in the sun, because messy wooded areas actually attract ticks. 

![Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-and-ticks-in-cats/v4-728px-Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-16-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Prevent wild animals from entering your yard. 

Keep stray cats, rodents, and deer out of your yard. These animals can carry fleas and ticks. Stop it by keeping bird feeders and woodpiles away from home, installing fences, blocking climbing paths, and planting plants that the deer do not like.
- Trees that block deer include boxwood, butterfly bush, the ginkgo tree, and jasmine. Check with your local seedling garden to learn more about possible plants.

![Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-and-ticks-in-cats/v4-728px-Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-17-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Spray insect growth regulator (IGR). 

These drugs disrupt the life cycle of fleas and stop their reproduction. IGR is considered safe for humans and pets, but harmful to fish. Be careful when using water sources.

![Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-and-ticks-in-cats/v4-728px-Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-18-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Spread diatomite soil around the yard. 

This natural product can be used in your garden to kill fleas, ticks, or other insects. It has the effect of dehydrating and shredding insects after they eat the powder. Be careful when using it. Always wear gloves and purchase a food-grade diatomite soil. Sprinkle them around the yard where you saw fleas or ticks.
- Avoid direct contact of hands with diatomite soil, be careful not to swallow or inhale. This ultra-fine powder is actually very sharp and can cause irritation to the skin or lungs if inhaled. However, when properly used outdoors, it will not harm people or pets.

![Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-and-ticks-in-cats/v4-728px-Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-19-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.6 Use an insecticide if you see a lot of fleas and ticks in your yard. 

To find out if there are fleas in your yard, put on white knee-length socks, and walk around the yard. If there are fleas, you will find them on your socks. You can call a professional exterminator or consult with your veterinarian to buy less expensive insecticides. For fleas, spray on areas where pets are normally located (like a kennel or a dog's house), under wooden floors, and next to the house's nails. To kill ticks, spray onto damp and shady areas of the yard.
- If you are handling your pet well and protecting your yard from ticks and fleas, you may not need to use an insecticide in your yard.
- Never use Pyrethroid-, Permethrin-, or Amitraz-containing products on cats or in the yard. These products can have many side effects on cats, even death.

## 4. Get fleas and ticks out of your home

![Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-and-ticks-in-cats/v4-728px-Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-20.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Vacuum thoroughly. 

Vacuum carpets and upholstery daily to eliminate fleas, eggs, and larvae. Don't forget to vacuum the carpet under your furniture. When vacuuming upholstered furniture, be sure to lift the mattresses and vacuum every corner of the furniture, including the cracks. Then, put the garbage bag in the vacuum cleaner in a sealed plastic bag and throw it in the trash outdoors.
- Most of the fleas in your home will be concentrated where your pet is located. Try to thoroughly clean those places. You should also clean any crevices and cracks around drawers and baseboards every day or every two days.

![Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-21]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-and-ticks-in-cats/v4-728px-Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-21.jpg.webp)

### 4.2 Wash household linens and linens. 

Wash your pet's bedding and small rugs each week with soap and hot water. You will also need to wash your pillowcase, pet bed, bed linens, and other household items. Washing in very hot water can kill flea eggs.

![Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-22]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-and-ticks-in-cats/v4-728px-Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-22.jpg.webp)

### 4.3 Treat the carpet with completely natural powder. 

Choose one of baking soda, borax, or silica gel and sprinkle it on indoor rugs. Rub the wool powder deep into the fibers of the carpet and leave overnight. The powder will drain the water of fleas that live in the carpet. The next day vacuum the carpet and throw the garbage bag in the machine in the trash can located outside the house. 
- Do not let your pet come near the carpet while there is powder on it. Only expose them to the carpet when vacuuming and powder are completely removed.

![Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-23]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-and-ticks-in-cats/v4-728px-Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-23.jpg.webp)

### 4.4 Choose insecticide. 

Choose a medicine with an insect growth regulator such as methoprene or pyriproxyfen. Read the label carefully to make sure the product can be used in homes with cats. If in doubt, check with your veterinarian before taking it. Be aware that insecticides cannot kill all stages of a flea's life cycle, so you may still see fleas for 2 weeks after you have treated. Continue vacuuming during this time to reduce the number of fleas.
- Never use products that contain pyrethroid, permethrin, or amitraz. These drugs can be fatal to cats.

![Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-24]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-and-ticks-in-cats/v4-728px-Kill-Fleas-and-Ticks-on-Cats-Step-24.jpg.webp)

### 4.5 Spray insecticide. 

Remove all people and pets from the room (including cats, birds, or reptiles). Cover the aquarium with a plastic sheet and turn off the aerator. Spray the medication directly on where pets usually lie. You can also spray carpets, furniture, baseboards, and window sills. Don't forget to spray the carpet under your furniture.
- Do not leave all household members (including pets) near the spraying area until it is dry (usually within 24 hours). Open windows or turn on the air conditioner for ventilation while the medicine is dry.
- Be sure to read the insecticide product label for more advice.

> Advice
- Read the label carefully. Follow all instructions for use.
- Refer to Green Paws, a Council for the Protection of Natural Resources website for more information on how to protect pets from harmful chemicals. This site provides poison tables, pet poisoning reports, and a list of chemicals to avoid.
- Keep the cat indoors. Your cat is less likely to get fleas and ticks if he stays indoors.
- Carefully sanitize used cloth upholstery and rugs before bringing them into your home to avoid bringing fleas into your home with furniture.
- Many types of ticks do not live in the home. But the dog brown tick can live indoors.

> Warning
- Find out the chemicals to avoid. Organic phosphorus compounds, as well as tetrachlorvinphos, are used in some flea killers. They are labeled "potentially carcinogenic in humans" and should be avoided. [35]
