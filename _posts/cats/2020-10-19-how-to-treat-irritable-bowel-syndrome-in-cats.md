## 1. Seek medical help

### 1.1 See your cat in the vet to determine the best treatment. 

The first step in treating irritable bowel syndrome (HCRKT) in cats is to consult a veterinarian. Your cat can recommend a variety of medical treatments and lifestyle changes to help your cat live a long, healthy life despite a chronic illness.
- A veterinarian is likely to diagnose HCRKT in a cat through a variety of tests and procedures. Usually, the disease is diagnosed with a gradual elimination of other causes and an extensive assessment of the cat's medical history.
- The treatment of HCWs can be difficult to determine because there is no effective cure or a single approach for all cases. Typically, treatment includes a combination of medications, dietary adjustments, or lifestyle changes. Sometimes it is necessary to try to find the most suitable treatment. Your veterinarian will advise on all approaches and guide you to try it in turn until you find one that works.
- Listen carefully to the veterinarian's advice and ask questions if you have questions about treating your cat. Especially with medication, you need to understand the correct supplement, dosage, and storage.

### 1.2 Ask your doctor about corticosteroids.  

Usually, the main treatment involves corticosteroids. Your veterinarian will prescribe a specific steroid and you will watch your cat see if your symptoms improve.
- Prednisolone is the most commonly prescribed Corticosteroid for cats. It has strong anti-inflammatory properties that help reduce the symptoms of HCRKT. Corticosteroids have a relatively high efficacy rate, providing symptom improvement in about 85% of infected cats.
- Corticosteroids are usually tolerated orally and within 3-4 months. If your cat's illness recurs when the medication is stopped, your doctor may prescribe another steroid medication or try other treatments.
- Cats need to be closely monitored by a veterinarian when taking steroids. Corticosteroids can lead to immunosuppression and diabetes. However, most infected cats are well tolerated if given the correct dose and on time. Usually, the drug is initially taken in high doses and gradually decreased.
- Cats may have difficulty taking medication and may occasionally vomit. In that case, you can ask your doctor about an oral steroid injection.

### 1.3 Try prescription antibiotics. 

Antibiotics are often used if a combination of dietary changes and corticosteroid medications do not provide symptom relief.
- Antibiotics work because sometimes HCRKT is caused by a bacterial factor. Metronidazole and Azithromycin are the two antibiotics most commonly prescribed.
- There are few side effects when taking the antibiotics, but some cats may experience vomiting due to the taste of the medicine.

### 1.4 Try immunosuppressants. 

Usually, immunosuppressants are used in addition if corticosteroids, and antibiotics are ineffective.
- Immunosuppressants are quite powerful and may help relieve symptoms in some cats. Like the above drugs, immunosuppressants can be taken by mouth.
- Immunosuppressants are the last resort option. This is because the drug is so powerful that it suppresses bone marrow in some cats. Your cat should be checked regularly by your doctor if you are taking immunosuppressants. Stop using the medication as soon as your doctor tells you to.

### 1.5 Use functional foods. 

Ask your veterinarian about using dietary supplements in your cat's diet. You can take supplements if it is appropriate and not interfere with other medications.
- Because bacteria play an important role in HCRKT, growth-stimulating drugs of certain types of bacteria, such as prebiotics and probiotics, can help reduce symptoms. Ask your doctor where to buy supplements and how to safely use them for your cat.
- Other supplements can be purchased at the health food store. A combination of many homeopathic methods is the simplest treatment. Just be sure to check with your doctor before changing your cat's treatment or diet.

## 2. Change your cat's diet

### 2.1 Try a hypoallergenic diet. 

Food allergies may be a contributing factor to irritable bowel syndrome (HCRKT) in cats. Choosing foods that are hypoallergenic can help reduce symptoms.
- Your veterinarian will recommend that you find sources of protein and carbohydrates that your cat has never eaten. A diet containing rabbit, venison, or duck meat is often good suggestions as most common cat foods do not contain these types of meat.
- Some cat food brands like Royal Canin Limited Ingredients Diet only use hypoallergenic products. Therefore, you can switch to products of this brand and see if symptoms improve.

### 2.2 Choose low residue foods. 

Low residue foods are designed to be easily digested and absorbed, reducing the problems associated with HCR.
- Most cat food brands are low residue but are not labeled “low residue foods”. Instead, the manufacturer may label the product "Scientific Formula". Therefore, you should ask your doctor what brand and type of food to buy. 
- The Iams brand offers foods that are labeled low residue and intended for cats with digestive problems. This is a brand you can try. If you can't find it in the stores, you can order it online.

### 2.3 Feed your cat foods high in fiber. 

Fiber is needed by many animals, including cats, for smooth, regular bowel movements. Adding more fiber to your cat may help improve diarrhea and abdominal discomfort associated with HCRKT.
- Many cat foods, such as the Royal Canin brand, are rich in fiber. Since most cat owners don't prioritize fiber in their diet, it can be difficult to find fiber-rich foods at the store. In that case, you can order online. 

## 3. Long-term care

### 3.1 Get your cat to exercise. 

Regular physical activity improves colon function and reduces symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (HCRKT).
- If released outside, your cat will have a chance to run around to exercise. Try to let the cat go out several times a week. If the windy weather interferes with your cat's outdoor activities, try indoor exercise.
- You cannot walk your cat like a dog. Therefore, physical activity for cats is usually indoor activities. You should prepare your cat a variety of toys, and pull and push them every day to make them feel interested. Let your cat play for 15-20 minutes a day. If your cat is more energetic and not tired after 20 minutes, you can play with her until she is no longer interested.
- If the cat is easy to contact, you can buy another cat. When living in groups, cats tend to be more physically active because they can run and play together. However, if your cat has behavioral problems with other animals, letting them live with other pets can stress them and cause HCRs to flare up.

### 3.2 Control your cat's stress. 

Cats with HCRKT can be caused by stress. Managing stress in cat life is essential to reducing HCRKT symptoms.
- Make sure your cat has a safe, private place in the house. Cats will likely want to stay away from the noise, especially when there are guests in the house, and they will want to hide in places like cat closets and houses.
- Limit changes in habits like feeding habits and resting sleep habits. If necessary, change your cat slowly. For example, if you move, you might want to familiarize your cat with the carrier before moving it to a new place.
- Always keep your cat's litter box clean. Poor sanitary conditions make cats uncomfortable. Leftover urine or feces in the toilet seat can be stressful for your cat. As a result, you should clean your cat's litter box daily and replace it every week.

### 3.3 Practice long-term diagnosis habits. 

HCRKT is not a curable disease. Cats with HCRKT will come back many times, and so it's important to understand how to make a long-term diagnosis.
- The disease can appear in periods. It can come back months or even years without symptoms. Because HCRKT is caused by many factors, prediction and prevention will not be simple. However, with the consultation of a doctor as soon as symptoms appear, the disease can be effectively controlled over time. 
- Regular visits to the vet are essential, especially if the cat has HCRKT. Your veterinarian can monitor symptoms over time and adjust treatments if necessary. You should take your cat to see the vet at the first sign of illness. 

> Warning
- Adhere to the treatment given by the veterinarian. Even if your cat feels better, you should never stop treatment without your doctor's approval. Stopping treatment early can cause the disease to return.
