Make sure your cat feels safe and comfortable in your presence before attempting to pick it up. Some cats need a "gentle" approach compared to others, especially cats that are afraid of humans or have a medical condition like arthritis. After a successful approach, you can pick up the cat while supporting its body properly.

## 1. Make your cat feel comfortable

### 1.1 Approach the cat. 

If you want to pick up a cat, first approach it so that it knows you are coming. You can talk softly, show your cat you, or show presented differently.
- If you pick up the cat from behind without letting it know you are approaching, it will feel scared, panicked, and restless.
- Some experts believe that you should approach the cat from the left or right, as approaching from behind can frighten the cat.
- Don't pick up cats that appear on the street before carefully examining the cat and its behavior. This can be feral and potentially dangerous. It's best to just pick up the cat you've seen before.

### 1.2 Get your cat acquainted with you. 

It takes time for your cat to adjust to your presence, even if you are the owner. Once the cat knows that you are approaching, be friendly, and show affection for the cat so that it is ready for you to pick you up. Most cats will become acquainted with their fellow humans by sniffing their faces, so you should do the same thing, focusing gently on their cheeks, forehead, behind the ears, or even under the chin if they are comfortable roof with you.
- The gentle act of cuddling can help your pet feel safe and loved, and ready to be picked up by you.
- If your cat is feeling a little tense, this can also help calm her down. Cats need time to be comfortable.

### 1.3 Make sure the cat wants to be picked up. 

Most cats will give clear signs that they don't want to be picked up. While you can slowly reassure and gain the trust of your cat by petting her head, you shouldn't be picked up if the cat is irritable or doesn't like to be held. If your cat tries to run away or scratches you, or starts attacking, pick it up another time.
- It is especially important to teach children who want to pick up a cat for these warning signs. Make sure your child picks up the cat only when she is calm and relaxed, and she trusts them. Children should not be scratched because the cat does not like to be picked.

## 2. Handling the cat properly

### 2.1 Move one hand under the cat's body, behind the front legs, just in case the cat is agreeing to be picked. 

Gently bring your hand over the cat's lower body, just below its hind legs, for support as you begin to pick up the cat. The cat will resist or dislike this at first, so move along with your body and use your other hand right after.
- You can use any hand to support the cat's lower body, just feel comfortable.
- Some people hold their front legs together and put their arms under their legs instead of between their legs.

### 2.2 Place your hands under your body near the hind legs. 

You can now run the other hand under the cat's hind legs, supporting her legs and hips. This pose is like holding a baby with one hand. Once you have your hands in place, you can pick up the cat.

### 2.3 Gently lift the cat. 

After holding the cat with both hands, you can lift the cat closer to your chest. You need to bring the cat closer to your body when you pick it up. This helps the cat feel more secure when handled. If the cat is too heavy to lift it, pick it up from a table or a raised surface.

### 2.4 Hold the cat in front of your chest. 

After picking up the cat while holding it tightly with both hands, you can hold the cat close to your chest so that the two bodies will come in contact with each other and the cat can lean back or the side of the face against your chest.
- In general, your cat should be in a straight position instead of sagging close to your chest, head and neck bent. This pose makes your pet uncomfortable and can resist and scratch you.
- You should always hold the cat with its head above the body. Do not turn the cat upside down!
- Cats sometimes enjoy being held in a variety of positions, especially if it's your cat and they feel around the owner. Some are acceptable to be held like a baby, while others prefer to rest their hind legs on your shoulders.

## 3. Put the cat down

### 3.1 Know when your cat doesn't like being held. 

When the cat starts fidgeting, moving, or meowing or trying to escape, let it down. You should not force him or her as this will make it very uncomfortable and feel threatened.
- Some cats do not like to hold them for long, so if you find that your cat is uncomfortable, let it go.

### 3.2 Gently place the cat on the ground. 

Do not throw them down as soon as it feels uncomfortable; This can cause the cat to lose its balance or land improperly. Instead, keep lowering the cat's body until all four feet touch the ground and then gently release the cat.
- Some cats will jump out of their arms immediately, so be prepared for this.

### 3.3 Do not carry the name of the cat. 

Although the mother usually brings her baby by stealing the nape of the neck, you should not do this with pets, especially if they are three months old or older. The cat has grown up now and that action can cause pain and muscle damage, as the cat is too heavy to bear the act.
- Although you or your veterinarian will need to grab the cat by the neck to administer medication or trim his paw, he or she should never grab the cat's nape and let it fall to the ground.

### 3.4 Be careful with supervision when your child picks up the cat. 

Children often love to pick up cats, but if they want to do so, you need to teach them how to do it appropriately. The child must be old enough to be able to pick up the cat. If the child is too young, they should hold the cat in a sitting position.
- After your child has picked up the cat, you will need to keep an eye on them to show when the cat needs to be released. This helps keep both the child and the cat from getting hurt.

> Advice
- Some cats do not like to be held. So you should not force them. Pick up cats only when needed, such as when they are seen, and maybe once a week for them to associate handling with vet visits.
- Use both hands to gently hold the cat. Do not pick up the cat with one hand under its abdomen, as this may cause discomfort and resistance.
- Approach your cat slowly and do not make any sudden movements. Then slowly bend over to let the cat sniff or get to know you. If the cat senses that you are not a threat, it will come closer.
- Approach your cat slowly and do not suddenly move, or you may scare the cat.
- Place your right hand behind the cat's foreleg.
- Do not pick up the cat if it is about to scratch and bite. However, if it is imperative that the cat be picked up (eg when seeing a veterinarian), wear long sleeves, in case they scratch or bleed without scratching or bleeding. If your cat bites or scratches hard, you should wear gloves to avoid scratching your hand.

> Warning
- Do not lift the cat by holding the cat's neck. A cat can be seriously injured if it doesn't hold its neck properly, and this position can make it easier for the cat to come back and scratch and bite you.
- If you have been scratched, wash the wound with soap and water, then apply an antibiotic. Take the same steps if you are bitten, then see your doctor as a cat bite can cause a serious infection.
- Do not pick up the cat from behind in an inappropriate position unless you know it is comfortable in this position. This action causes the cat to feel insecure and trapped, panic, and scratch you. Always hold the cat in an upright position close to your body for safety.
- Always be aware of the dangers of bites and scratches.
- Do not pick up a strange cat before learning, and never pick up a stray or stray cat.
