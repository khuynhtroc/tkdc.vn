> Cats are popular pets and are often welcome in the home. However, in some cases, having one or more stray cats wandering around the house will cause unnecessary annoyance. If you are having this problem, here are some simple methods to use to get rid of them and reclaim your space.

## 1. Clean up Food and Shelter

### 1.1 Tie up the trash. 

Wild cats often find food in your home. While it may not be appealing to humans at all, new or aged piles of trash can be a delicious source of food for cats. Always take care to protect the trash can to prevent cats from jumping in foraging.
- Always keep the lid on the trash can tightly.
- Collect all rubbish in the sealed bin.

### 1.2 Talk to the neighbors. 

If you have a problem with stray cats messing around with your furniture, talking to your neighbor may help. Talking to your neighbor will help you discover the reasons for your cat trouble and work together to fix it. Work with your neighbor to resolve the problems caused by the stray cats.
- If there are lots of cats in your neighborhood, working with your neighbors makes the neighborhood less attractive to cats.
- Your neighbor may have left cat litter or other food sources out. Have them close their trash cans and don't scatter feral cat food to help minimize trouble.
- Ask your neighbor to find and seal the feral cat's ideal hiding places. This could be an old barn or porch where stray cats use it as a shelter.

### 1.3 Block all access to the shelter. 

Like other animals, cats need shelter, and they may be attracted to your home in search of this shelter. By blocking the entire entrance to the sheltered area you can make the house less attractive to stray cats as they pass by.
- Fencing on porch or dirt floors.
- Seal gaps and narrow gaps in your home or garage.

### 1.4 Fencing the access area. 

If you find that the feral cat is approaching a specific area, put up a fence to prevent it from getting inside. It is difficult for your cat to climb or climb down a fence, this will stop it from hanging around the area.
- Use thin wire mesh as a fence to help save money and make it easier to handle.
- The vertical fence should be tilted outwards so that it is difficult for the cat to climb over.
- Fence off your yard so cats cannot live in this area.

## 2. Using Cat Repellent

### 2.1 Install motion trigger nozzle. 

Cats are often afraid of water and will avoid getting wet. Putting a motion-trigger or running water feature in your garden will prevent your cat from reaching near your yard in the first place.
- Motion-activated nozzles shoot water jets out as the cat approaches and frighten them.

### 2.2 Use ultrasonic equipment. 

Ultrasonic devices emit a sound at a frequency higher than the maximum frequency heard by the human ear. However, cats are able to hear ultrasound and do not like these sounds, leaving them out of your home area. Try using ultrasound to keep stray cats out of the house. 
- Place the ultrasound devices near stray cats or other accessible areas such as your garden or other places where you will find them wandering around.

### 2.3 Protect flower beds and plants. 

Cats often treat trees and flowers as trash cans. They will harm the garden, destroy the plants that you take the effort to sow. Protecting flower beds and gardens will prevent them from damaging and keep the plant safe.
- You can put up a thin steel fence around the garden or plug it into the ground.
- Put in some pine cones, rock mulch, or cedar mulch to make the garden an unattractive place for cats.

### 2.4 Use industrial cat repellents. 

Industrial cat repellents will leave scents around your home that will make your cat uncomfortable. You can buy and use commercial cat repellents to make your yard a bad smell for passing cats.

### 2.5 Use natural scents to keep cats away. 

If you are reluctant to use industrial cat repellents, you can use natural or homemade repellents. Dispense the following natural repellants around your home to keep cats away. 
- Lavender.
- Lemongrass.
- Lemon orange juice.
- Garlic.
- Dog urine.
