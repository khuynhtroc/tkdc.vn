## 1. Determine what caused your cat to cry

### 1.1 Learn about kitten growth. 

Your kitten will go through certain stages in its development. Understanding these stages will help you identify why your cat makes noise and find the best way to comfort them. The stages in a kitten's development include:
- From birth to 2 weeks of age: the kitten knows the direction of sounds, its eyes are open, and will cry when the mother or siblings cannot be found.
- From 2 to 7 weeks: Kittens begin to interact, play, and will wean when they are about 6 to 7 weeks old, though, they may still latch on their mothers' habits.
- From 7 to 14 weeks old: the kitten will be more interactive and active. Kittens should not be separated from their mother or herd before 12 weeks of age to minimize the risk of developing bad behavior. Additionally, a kitten that is gently petted for 15 to 40 minutes a day for the first 7 weeks will have a larger brain development.

### 1.2 Determine what caused your cat to cry. 

Kittens can complain about a variety of reasons, such as being separated from their mothers too soon or hungry. Knowing why your cat makes noise will help you identify the right cat's needs and comfort it properly. Cats may cry out because:
- Cats are separated from their mothers or separated too soon.
- Your cat wants to be petted or noticed.
- Hungry cat.
- The cat is cold.
- Cats are unusually hungry or restless due to illness.
- Cats need to poop.

### 1.3 Be aware of your kitten's chirping problem. 

A kitten that makes too much noise may just be his way of expressing himself. Realizing that purring is perfectly normal behavior for cats and kittens will help you get used to the occasional peep. 
- You need to be able to determine when the kitten is calling too much or for what needs and if you need to stop it.
- Note that some breeds of cats, such as the Siamese, are more vocal.

### 1.4 See veterinarian. 

If you are unsure why your cat is complaining or are concerned about the cat's health, make an appointment with your vet. They will help you identify the cause of your cat's chirping and come up with the best way to fix it.
- Let your vet know when your cat started to complain a lot and what will make it less likely or make it more vocal. You can also tell your doctor how long the cat is allowed to stay with her mother and her flock.
- Bring your cat's medical records if you have one.
- Answer your veterinarian's questions honestly so that the kitten is properly treated.

## 2. Pat the kitten

### 2.1 Pick up the cat. 

Most kittens like to be held and petted by their owner. This will help the kitten feel like she is being cared for by the mother cat and will help them interact and develop optimally.
- Be gentle with your cat. You should pick up the cat with both hands so it won't fall over.
- Avoid picking up your cat by grabbing it by the neck to minimize the risk of injury.
- Holding the cat in your hand is like holding a baby — it may not like lying on its back, but it will lie on your arm and nuzzle your head into your elbow.
- You can leave a thin blanket/towel in your hand to let the kitten snuggle, but don't put the blanket on the cat to avoid frightening him.

### 2.2 Gentle caresses. 

Gently petting the cat even when it is lying beside it or when you pick it up. This will help calm your cat, stop calling, and be more intimate with you.
- Focus on petting the cat's head, neck, and chin area. Avoid tails or other sensitive areas.
- You should not be too aggressive.
- Brush the kitten twice a week or more if it shows interest.

### 2.3 Talk to the kitten. 

Interaction is an important part of how your kitten develops and forms a bond with you. When a kitten or whenever your cat is playing, talk to her to let her know that you are also communicating with it. 
- Talk to your cat when you pet it, pick it up, feed it, or whenever it comes near you. 
- Speak in a gentle voice and don't yell to avoid frightening the cat.
- You can name and praise the kitten. For example, “Miu wants you to be picked up, right? Miu likes you to hold her like this, right? Miu is very good ".

### 2.4 Play with your cat. 

Play is another important factor in helping your cat to develop and bond with you. A cat chirping may be a sign that it wants attention and play is a good way for you to meet this need.
- Have a bag of age-appropriate toys available to your cat, such as a ball or large toy mouse that your cat cannot swallow. You should also have a scratching table ready for your cat.
- You can throw the ball back and forth to the kitten.
- Tie a toy to the end of a string and let the cat chase it. When you are no longer playing, keep an eye on your cat and keep the toy in a place where your cat can't get it. Kittens can experience serious intestinal problems or even death if the string is swallowed.

### 2.5 Make your cat a comfortable bed. 

Preparing your cat for a cozy place to sleep will make it comfortable, calm, and quiet. You can buy or spread a soft towel or blanket into a box to make your cat's bed.
- Cover your cat's bed with an item you have used, such as a sweater or even a blanket to let the cat get used to your scent.

### 2.6 Feed the cat. 

Kittens need nutritious foods for their bodies to develop in a healthy way. Adequate feeding will also stop the cat from crying. 
- You should mix canned cat food with kittens milk to soften the food until the cat is 10 weeks old. Your cat's food should have the same consistency as oatmeal. This is especially helpful when the kitten has to be weaned early or abandoned.
- Avoid plain milk, as these can cause stomach upset.
- Use a ceramic or metal bowl for your cat food. Some kittens can be quite sensitive to plastic.
- Have a separate bowl of clean water for your cat.
- Make sure your cat's food and water are new and that the bowls are clean.

### 2.7 Clean your cat litter box. 

Cats and kittens are quite sensitive to cleanliness, especially the litter box. You need to keep the kitten's litter box clean and close to the cat, which will also make it quieter.
- Make sure the litter box is just the right size for your cat to get in and out of easily.
- You should use a hygienic sandbox that is dust-free and odorless.
- Shovel waste out of the box as soon as possible. Do this every day to encourage your cat to use the litter box.
- Keep the sandbox away from your cat's food bowl. Kittens do not like food placed near where it is pooping.

### 2.8 Give your cat medicine. 

If your veterinarian has determined that the cause of your cat's chirping is sick, give your cat medication and treatment as directed by your veterinarian to help it recover and stop too much vocalization.
- Make sure you give your cat the full medication.
- Talk to your veterinarian carefully about how to give your cat medication to minimize damage.

### 2.9 Avoid ignoring or scolding your kitten. 

Unless you know your cat's needs and don't want to respond, you should not ignore its calls, it may not be in the litter box or have no potable water. In the same way, don't scold the kitten for making too much noise. Scolding not only will not stop the cat from crying but also makes it sacred.
