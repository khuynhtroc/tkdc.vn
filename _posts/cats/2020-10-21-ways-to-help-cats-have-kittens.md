> Whether you have purebred cats as a job for a living or take care of a cat, it is important to know what to do when the cat is laboring and giving birth. The typical gestation period for cats is between 65-67 days, so once you know your cat is pregnant, you need to start preparing for delivery. Here is what you have to do.

## 1. Prepare for Labor

### 1.1 Watch for signs of pregnancy. If your cat does any of the following, it may be pregnant.

Typical signs of pregnancy include larger, pinker nipples, larger belly and no longer calling for sex partners.

### 1.2 Get your cat checked. 

Once you know your cat is pregnant (or at least suspect), take the cat to a licensed vet for a checkup.
- Your veterinarian can determine if your cat is pregnant without much work. They will give you good advice on how to best prepare your kitten for the birth.
- In particular, if your cat is overweight or has a history of unhealthy health it is necessary to bring it to the vet as soon as you suspect pregnancy, otherwise, your cat will be at risk. health.
- In some cases, a doctor may be able to determine if a continued pregnancy poses a danger to the mother cat to perform abortions and castration for humanitarian purposes.
- The veterinarian also estimates how many kittens the mother cat is pregnant with and this is very helpful for you in mid-delivery.

### 1.3 Adjust your cat's diet in the late stages. 

When a cat reaches its third stage of pregnancy (about 42 days of pregnancy or when its belly is visibly enlarged), it will have different nutritional needs, so make sure the mother cat has a sufficient supply of food. necessary.
- Keep your cat on its usual diet for the first two-thirds of the cycle.
- In the late stages, feeding the kitten with more calories in a small amount of food because the already large pregnancy starts to overwhelm the stomach and the kitten food is a good idea to maintain. nutrition for the mother cat.

### 1.4 Make a nest. 

Your cat needs a warm, quiet, safe place to give birth, and the mother will actively seek out such a place before giving birth. When the cat starts to find the nest, it means that it is only a few days until labor and this is the perfect opportunity to direct the cat to where you have prepared it.
- The laundry room or bathroom is the perfect place; just make sure there are no children or dogs in the area as the mother needs to feel safe and relaxed in her nest.
- Prepare clean water, food, and a small box (food, drink, and sandbars should be placed more than half a meter from the nest to minimize the risk of disease)
- Find a high-walled paper box and spread some towels, soft blankets, newspapers, etc. anything old that you don't mind if it gets dirty.
- Regardless of the material you choose, it should have no smell as the cats' sense of smell is very sensitive and will refuse to use the box.

### 1.5 Prepare for the birth of a kitten. Continue to feed high-quality food and watch, if the mother does not eat significantly, it is a sign that labor is imminent.

If the mother cat is a long-haired breed, consider trimming the hair around her vulva (a few days or a week before birth). Some have suggested that extra hair should be shaved around the breast to prevent the kitten from swallowing the hair during feeding.
- If you have not been able to trim your cat's toenails before the time of delivery, do not do so immediately as it will interfere with the kitten's ability to recognize her mother's natural smell.

### 1.6 You also need to be prepared. In addition to items such as cat litter boxes, cat food, water, and litter boxes, you should have something available to use in the event of an emergency.

Keep the cat bag nearby for easy access to the veterinarian if anything goes wrong.
- The phone always has a battery, veterinarian and veterinary hospital number must be backed up so that it is easy to find and easy to call in case there are complications during delivery.
- Have a bunch of clean towels available to use when you need to clean your kitten.
- Buy kitten formula and bottles from the pet store so you can take care of the kittens with the mother cat.

### 1.7 Keep track of the timing of the pregnancy cycle. Pregnancy can be unusually long and it is difficult to pinpoint the exact date of delivery. So a cat that is 67 days pregnant needs a professional screening.

The veterinarian will use the machine to scan the mother's belly to check the kitten's health and extend it for another 4-5 days. If the kitten is not yet born during that time, a cesarean section should be performed.

![Help-a-Cat-Give-Birth-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-help-cats-have-kittens/v4-728px-Help-a-Cat-Give-Birth-Step-8-Version-6.jpg.webp)

### 1.8 Watch for signs of complications. 

Signs of danger include abnormal discharge and illness.
- Abnormal fluids: The mucus secreted from a cat's vulva during pregnancy is not normal. A slightly yellowish-green discharge is a sign of uterine infection, pale green is a sign of placental separation and a bleeding vulva is most likely caused by a ruptured placenta. If you notice these signs, contact your veterinarian immediately.
- Illness: During pregnancy, the mother's body is under pressure and her immune system becomes weak. If the cat does not appear well (vomiting, diarrhea, coughing, sneezing, loss of appetite) then take it to the vet immediately.

## 2. Supporting Labor

### 2.1 Keep distance. 

Most of the mother cat's delivery does not need you. However, your presence, at least close to this area, will reassure it.
- Keep enough distance for the mother to focus on giving birth but close enough to intervene when necessary.
- Be prepared for risks and know the signs of complications.

![Help-a-Cat-Give-Birth-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-help-cats-have-kittens/v4-728px-Help-a-Cat-Give-Birth-Step-10-Version-6.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Know when your cat is about to go into labor. 

Get used to the signs that the cat is about to give birth. Stage 1 usually lasts 12 to 24 hours with the following signs:
- Sluggish or restless, find a place to hide (show your cat a nest)
- Lick carefully, especially the vulva
- Walk slowly and gasp
- Purring and crying loudly
- Body temperature decreased by one to two degrees from normal by 38.9ÂºC
- Stop eating
- Vomit
- If you find that your cat is bleeding, get professional help right away. Bleeding before birth is a sign that something is wrong and that the cat needs medical intervention.

### 2.3 Clean and disinfect your hands in case you need help. 

Take off your watch and ring, then use antibacterial soap to wash your hands. Rub soap on the back of your hands and on your wrists. You must rub soap on your hands for at least 5 minutes. Use a nail brush or an old toothbrush to clean underneath the nail.
- Do not use hand sanitizer! It doesn't kill the bacteria completely and you don't want the other cat to lick the ingredients in the hand sanitizer that is still on the kittens, making the whole group sick.
- Hand washing is just a precaution and the mother should be active on her own during the process. Only intervene if a kitten is having trouble, then put it back in the nest as soon as possible.

![Help-a-Cat-Give-Birth-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-help-cats-have-kittens/v4-728px-Help-a-Cat-Give-Birth-Step-12-Version-6.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 Keep an eye on after each kitten is born. 

Once the mother cat enters the nest box and begins to deliver, the best thing you can do is to remain quiet, ready, and closely watched throughout. Remember that you and your cat's surroundings should be quiet, as if anything distracts, another animal is nearby, or the mother is moved to an unfamiliar place. Childbirth will be delayed. The next transformation of labor, Stage 2, will typically develop as follows:
- The cervix dilates and the mother starts to constrict her uterus.
- The contractions are intense and the first kitten will enter the birth canal. This takes place in 2-3 minutes, usually, the mother will choose a squatting position. It can groan loudly and pant.
- The amniotic fluid (the discharge comes off) comes first, followed by the kitten (head or legs first).
- Once Stage 2 begins, it will last for about half an hour to an hour and the first cat will be born. Each kitten is about half an hour apart, sometimes up to an hour.
- If the mother has calmed down for more than an hour and continues to push hard without the kitten coming out, it doesn't seem right. Look for anything in the mother's pussy. If there is nothing then it's best to call the vet. If the kitten does, let the mother try for another 5 minutes. At the moment it is not going well, you should help. Wash your hands well, then grab the part of the kitten you see, and gently pull the mother at the same time as the mother cat contracts her uterus. If the kitten still does not come out easily, contact your doctor.

![Help-a-Cat-Give-Birth-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-help-cats-have-kittens/v4-728px-Help-a-Cat-Give-Birth-Step-13-Version-6.jpg.webp)

### 2.5 Make sure the mother cat breaks the amniotic fluid and licks each kitten clean. 

It will lick and break the amniotic sac so that the kitten can breathe and move at the same time.
- If the mother does not do that quickly, you should intervene, put on sterile gloves and break the amniotic sac so the kitten can breathe. Wipe the kitten's face with a clean, dry cloth.
- Return them to the mother by placing the kittens under the cat's nose. If the kitten remains lethargic and the kitten begins to shiver from wet, dry it by wiping it with a clean, dry cloth. This is to make the kitten cry and to attract the mother's attention and interest. This is a good time to put the kitten in the nest with the mother.

![Help-a-Cat-Give-Birth-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-help-cats-have-kittens/v4-728px-Help-a-Cat-Give-Birth-Step-14-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 2.6 Examination of the placenta. 

Each kitten will have a placenta and it needs to be removed from the mother's body. Pay attention to each placenta, as leftovers in the abdomen will cause infection and the mother will die.
- DO NOT CORRECT EFFECT. If you pull on the umbilical cord, the mother's uterus will be torn away and death is inevitable. Take the mother cat to the vet if you suspect that the placenta is still in its womb.
- Be aware that it's okay for cats to re-eat the placenta. The placenta is full of nutrients and hormones that can supplement the mother's body, so don't interfere with this process. Just make sure it doesn't try to eat your baby as it may not have had the baby experience yet.
- Only let the mother cat eat a few placentae, the rest should be carried away because too many nutrients at a time can cause diarrhea or vomiting.

![Help-a-Cat-Give-Birth-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-help-cats-have-kittens/v4-728px-Help-a-Cat-Give-Birth-Step-15-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 2.7 Do not cut the umbilical cord. 

Many opinions suggest that we should NOT cut the umbilical cord of the placenta. Most mother cats will chew on themselves. If the mother cat doesn't do that, consult your vet.
- Do not cut the umbilical cord if it is still inside the mother. Because the umbilical cord is attached to the placenta, the placenta can become trapped inside the cat's belly and cannot be cleared by itself. This will lead to infection and the mother cat in danger. Instead of trying yourself without being sure, call your doctor and follow the directions.

## 3. Help Postpartum

![Help-a-Cat-Give-Birth-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-help-cats-have-kittens/v4-728px-Help-a-Cat-Give-Birth-Step-16-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Make sure the kittens are fed as soon as possible.

Initial breast milk, also known as colostrum, has very good nutrients and antibodies for kittens.
- Newborn cats are both blind and deaf and reach their mother's breast through smell and touch. Sometimes they do it right away, sometimes they recover a little while after they start to breastfeed.
- The mother may wait until all kittens are born before she can feed them. However, if it shows signs of refusing to breastfeed, use a formula and bottle that you have prepared to feed the kittens yourself.
- If the kitten is trying to suck and purr at the same time, the mother may have a problem with lactation. In this case, the veterinarian may stimulate its milk glands and in the meantime, you should continue bottle-feeding the kitten.

![Help-a-Cat-Give-Birth-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-help-cats-have-kittens/v4-728px-Help-a-Cat-Give-Birth-Step-17-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Take care of your kitten's health. 

Keep an eye on the cats to make sure they are adjusting and adapting well.
- If a kitten makes a screeching or suffocating sound, there may be fluid in its airways. Place the cat between your hand, head on fingertips, with the other hand holding it tightly (imagine a bird's crossbow). Remember to use gloves and be very careful as newborn cats are very slippery. Gently shake the cat up and down. This will allow fluid to drain out of its lungs. Use gauze to clean the face of the baby cat.
- If the mother cat shows no interest in the kitten, try rubbing her own scent on the kittens. If that doesn't work, take care of the kittens yourself including regular feeding and incubation. There are too many details on this to be included here so please consult your doctor.
- Don't be alarmed if a cat is stillborn (dead). Make sure it is dead before you proceed. Try stimulating it by rubbing it with a damp, warm washcloth. Or you can lift and lower its legs and breathe it into the cat's face and mouth.

### 3.3 Take care of the mother's health. 

Place a nutritious amount of food with clean water near the nest after the baby is finished. The cat may not want to leave her baby or even use a sandbox, so keep all of it as close as possible so that it can meet her needs without going away from the cubs. The mother cat needs to eat to keep up with its energy and nursing nutrients.
- The mother may not be able to get up during the first few days after giving birth, so keep the food close to the nest.
- Check the mother's recovery and how well she cares for her baby.

![Help-a-Cat-Give-Birth-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/ways-to-help-cats-have-kittens/v4-728px-Help-a-Cat-Give-Birth-Step-19-Version-5.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Record information.

Record time of birth, sex, weight (using a kitchen scale), and a number of placentae.
- This information will be useful in the future when it comes to medical issues.

> Advice
- As the time of delivery approaches, consider covering your bed and blanket with a dark shade. Because even if you have a litter box ready, the mother can decide to give birth in your bed because of its familiar smell and a sense of security.
- If you do not need to go near the cat while it is giving birth. You may be bitten and scratched by it. Only help when the mother is in trouble.
- Unless you want to breed a cat, consider castrating it, for the sake of a future kitten (many unintended cases such as a stray pregnant cat and starving the kitten) and also for the cat your house. Castration reduces the risk of developing purulent uteritis that can lead to infection and death if left undetected.
- Do not interfere with the cat's breeding if the cat does not need help.

> Warning
- If the mother cat has been in labor for 2 hours and has not yet had a kitten, you will need to see a veterinarian urgently. Similarly, if the kittens are born, the mother takes more than an hour. The best you can do for them is to stay calm and contact your doctor for a solution.
- See your doctor's office immediately if you see the following warning signs:
- The first cat does not come out after an hour of vaginal spasm
- One part of the kitten will come out but not all
- The mother cat began to bleed her vulva
