## 1 Prepare to wean the kitten

### 1.1 Determine when to wean your kitten. 

Weaning begins when the cat is about four weeks old. For most kittens, this process usually ends when they are eight to ten weeks old. Once the kitten has opened its eyes, has the ability to focus and walk steadily, you can begin the process. [first]
- Around 10-14 days old, the kitten's eyes and ears will begin to open. By about 2 to 3 weeks, they will begin to be able to stand and falter, develop muscle, and practice walking. During this time, they still absorb nutrients from breast milk. When the mother sees that her baby is stable, she will begin the natural weaning process.

### 1.2 Buy the necessary nutrients. 

When you first wean your kitten, buy a milk substitute. This product is formulated to simulate the nutritional value and taste of mother's milk. Also, make sure to buy a high-quality product for the kitten to get used to. You can read on the package whether the ingredients contain meat or not. This means that the product has a high protein ratio, which is essential for growing kittens for good health. [2]
- Do not give kittens cow's milk. This is not a suitable substitute, because the kitten's stomach cannot be digested and there is a risk of diarrhea. [3]

### 1.3 Buy shallow food and water bowls. 

You can also use a ceramic or plastic bowl. The kitten should be able to reach the bottom of the bowl easily. They will drink milk replacements and eat their food much more easily if the food is easily accessible. [4]

### 1.4 Don't suddenly separate the kitten from the mother. 

Kittens, like children, learn with observation. They will observe the mother's diet, use the litter box, and play. It will then mimic this behavior. If you have both the mother and the kittens in the house, keep them together for as long as possible - or at least until after 10 weeks. They will naturally separate from their mother over time.
- You can keep your kittens separate for a few hours a day when they are four weeks old. They still need to be provided with a separate toilet tray and food / drink. Eventually, the kittens will become more independent and willing to leave their mother. [5]
- Don't worry too much when the kittens are motherless. They have strong survival instincts. The kitten will find a way to feed itself, even if the mother is not around. Most orphan kittens wean and switch to providing solids sooner than usual, by the time the cat is four weeks old or older. At this point, the cat's stomach has already grown to the point where it can digest solid foods. They just need to be taught how to eat solid foods. [6]

## 2. Wean your cat

### 2.1 Introduce the kitten to the replacement milk. 

At first, the kitten will need to eat 4-5 meals a day. Each meal includes 1/3 cup milk replacements and kitten food. [7] Your kitten will sleep through the night without food or drink, but if it is screaming, feed it before going to bed. [8]
- If your newborn cat is separated from its mother, you will need to simulate its suckling instinct using a dropper. Pour the replacement milk into the tube and then lift the kitten up and place a few drops of milk in her mouth. Alternatively, you can dip your finger in the milk and let the kitten lick the milk in your hand. [9]

### 2.2 Let the kitten practice eating in a bowl. 

This can be a tricky process for them. If kittens are used to breastfeeding, then a food bowl is a bit of a weird thing. You just need to instruct the kitten to locate the milk. Dip your finger in the bowl and show it to the kitten. It will recognize the taste and want to explore more.
- Do not press the cat's head into the bowl. If you do, they can inhale the milk and affect the lungs. [10] If your kitten is uncomfortable at first, try returning to bottle-feeding or breast-feeding. However, with each feeding, you should first contact the kittens to encourage them to drink from the bowl.

### 2.3 Give the kitten solid food. 

Once the kitten has gotten used to eating in the bowl, you can feed the porridge mixture. To make the mix, you need to mix high quality kitten food with a milk substitute. The texture should be similar to the oatmeal. Many people use a blender to mix cat food with milk replacers. [11]
- You can practice feeding your kitten porridge and other watery foods when the kitten is around 5-6 weeks old. [twelfth]

### 2.4 Switch to solid foods after 8 to 10 weeks. 

After you stop feeding your kitten porridge, give it to cat food soaked. When switching to kittens, provide a bowl of fresh water for them.
- To complete the transition, fill the kitten's food less and less with water until it becomes familiar with the original food texture. You should always place a bowl of clean water next to the cat's food tray. [13]
- Kittens need to be fed four times a day until they are six months old. At this point, you can cut down to two meals a day. [14]
- Consult with your veterinarian about feeding methods. Some doctors recommend a "free feeding method" instead of a scheduled feeding. Proponents of this approach claim that this approach can please even the most demanding cats - or those that don't eat at the scheduled time. In general, if this makes your cat happier, it's okay to do so. If your cat is overweight, consider feeding a schedule to limit the amount of food they eat each day. [15]

> Advice
- When the kitten is first introduced to the food in the bowl, the kitten may jump in and play with its food. Be patient and wipe off the fur with a soft cloth. Eventually the kitten will realize the purpose of the food bowl.
