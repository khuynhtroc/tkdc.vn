### 1.1 Observe the cat's tail. 

Just like dogs, cats communicate by tail position and movement. By knowing your cat's tail position signs and sounds, you will be able to understand your cat's needs and wants. Some common tail placements include:
- The tail is erect and arched at the end: the cat is happy.
- Tail twitching: they feel excited or anxious for a long time.
- The tail is erect or ruffled: the cat is excited or threatened.
- Tails vibrate: they are very excited and excited to meet you.
- The tail is raised and the tail curled at the end in an N-shape: this is a sign of aggression and can appear during a fight with a strange cat or in self-defense.
- The tail is erect, but the tail is hanging low: your cat is feeling hostile or frightened.
- The tail swoops down and hides it: they are frightened.

### 1.2 Make eye contact with the cat. 

By observing their eyes, you can get closer to the cat and understand its inner feelings. However, do not stare into their eyes without blinking, as this is a threatening behavior that will make your cat uncomfortable.
- If the pupil is dilated, the cat is feeling happy or excited or rather scared or aggressive; you should incorporate their behavior to be specific. 
- A cat making eye contact shows that it trusts and feels comfortable around you.
- A cat blinking slowly can be a sign of affection, meaning that it is comfortable with people around.

### 1.3 Pay attention to another body language. Because cats are more “proficient” than humans with body language, certain gestures are often accompanied by a cry to convey a message.

A cat pushes its nose and tucks its head back slightly means "I admit you." A cat sitting at the window may greet you this way as you pass.
- Cats put their ears off after feeling scared, stressed, or excited. This may occur when the cat sniffs carefully to learn about an object.
- A cat sticking out its tongue and licking its lower lip means they are worried or scared.

### 1.4 Identify communication behavior. 

Some forms of cat communication are based on how they behave around you. Certain behaviors tend to mean consistency in most cats.
- A cat scratching a friend's fur means they are marking their possession.
- A wet nose kiss shows affection when a cat touches your nose. This means they like and feel comfortable around you.
- A cat scratching its head, walking around, and wrapping its tail around a person or animal is a typical act of greeting.
- Cheerful head-washing shows his friendliness and love.
- The cat sniffs a human's face for recognition by a familiar scent.
- A cat is pampering with its paws, switching between its right and left leg as a sign of happiness, contentment, or play. The act of massage shows them know and trust you.
- A cat licks you by tongue to show absolute confidence. They can see you as a family member, like a grooming mother and a kitten.
- If your cat is trying to poke at your hair, it may be "grooming" you. This means that they truly love and trust you.
- Some cats show true love by imitating actions. You can check by "fake death" on the floor. The cat will smell and push gently, and then fake death.
- In the event of a minor bite, this is a warning sign that you should leave it alone.

## 2. Communicate with Cats

### 2.1 Communicate with your cat. 

They always learn to communicate with us. The more you communicate, the faster they learn.
- Use a slightly high tone to convey friendliness and a low tone of voice to convey dissatisfaction or aggression.
- Repetition helps your cat determine the right course of action. You can repeat a word like "sleep" or "bed" each time you go to bed. Eventually, the cat will begin to associate the sound of the repeated word with your actions and may even go to bed before you.

### 2.2 Use non-verbal cues. 

Cats can be taught to understand words, but they have the instinct to recognize nonverbal cues. You can create a warm, intimate environment with clear aspirations and incorporate surprises to bond with the cat you have just brought home.
- If you blink slowly while looking at your cat, the cat will respond by approaching or petting. This is considered a non-threatening gesture.
- Don't stare directly into the cat's eyes. Otherwise, the cat will think that you are hostile or aggressive.
- If the cat wants to go somewhere, say, sitting next to you on the couch but is unsure, pat the chair surface and use a gentle, positive tone to invite her to sit beside you.
- Always be consistent between gesture intent. Many pet owners often give a vague signal when saying "no" but petting the cat at the same time. This makes them feel confused. So, if you want the cat to move away, then steadfastly act and gently push the cat, so that he or she knows the presence is inappropriate. Most cats try to occupy human space two to three times from different directions. When you say "Later", you must be very patient.
- Do not scold or punish your cat with physical action. This will only frighten and anger your cat, which is not only beneficial but also harmful. Instead, use a stern tone to convey your dissatisfaction. Your cat will understand this and feel unhappy with you.

### 2.3 Communicate commands to your cat. 

Always be consistent between the use of words, tone of voice, and some other signs when giving a command to help you both unify and capture a clear aspiration.
- Use a commanding tone when the cat is doing something you think is inappropriate. It should be natural and easy to repeat but should be different from your everyday voice. When you use this toneless often but seriously, your cat will learn to associate the voice with the meaning that it is making you unhappy.
- Use a quick and high-pitched whistle to express the command "no". This sound can convey the same punishment or warning as in “cat language” and you can use it to convey your intentions more clearly to your cat.
- With patience, cats can be trained to learn to respond to commands like dogs. You can even teach them how to shake hands.

## 3. Listen to the Cat

### 3.1 Learn how and why cats communicate. 

Calling in general is not your cat's preferred form of communication. A cat's "native language" is a complex system of scents, facial expressions, complex body language, and touch. Cats soon learn that we are unable to grasp the nonverbal cues they send, so they cry out in order to communicate in "our" language. By observing what sounds are associated with each of our actions, they always learn to make requests or commands.

### 3.2 Observe the situation where you make a meow. 

If you look closely at the action when it calls out, you can discern which cry is associated with each request (or protest). A cat meow can be different for individual cats, and there are specific calls associated with their particular emotions, such as wheezing or whining.
- The short meow is usually greetings and acknowledgments in general.
- The act of making multiple meows is usually an excited greeting. You may find a more welcoming welcome with increasing meows as you go away for longer than usual.
- The middle tone meows is usually a plea for food or water.
- The persistent "Mrrroooow" represents a persistent need to meet either a desire or a need.
- "MRRRooooowww" in low tones represents complaints, dissatisfaction, or prepared to fight.
- A loud "meow" on the lower middle tone is usually a sign of urgent begging for food.

### 3.3 Identify your cat's common form of meow-free communication. 

While meows are the sounds we often associate with catcalls, they make other common sounds.
- A wheezing or hoarse sound is often a sign that invites close contact or attention. While cats can wheeze for a variety of reasons, this is often a sign of contentment in themselves.
- A screeching sound is a clear sign of aggression or defense. When they make this sound, they are unhappy, feeling threatened or scared, or are fighting or preparing to fight.

### 2.4 Notice some other special calls. 

While more vocalizations can be rarer than the meows, hiss, and wheezes, getting a better grasp of how they communicate.
- ARROW! in high tones emanate when they are angry, in pain, or scared.
- A roaring noise can be a sign of excitement, anxiety, or disappointment.
- The chirping sound of a meow and a raised wheeze is often the friendly hello that the mother cat often uses to call her cubs.
- A loud scream or a "reeeowww" sound is often caused by sudden pain in the event you accidentally step on their tail.

> Advice
- Always love and respect your cat, then they will be your happy and loving companion.
- Sitting cross-legged on the floor and looking at your cat is a sign that you are welcoming, so they can come close so you can pet.
- Don't make a loud noise when the cat is scared. If not, the cat will assume this is a sign of fear.
- When a cat bites you, it may be playing or being satisfied.
- When the cat moves away or runs away, leave it alone; This shows they need their own space.
- When a cat bites, this doesn't necessarily mean aggression. Sometimes it's just a "love bite" or a light bite to have fun. Most "love bites" are usually gentle and they won't hurt you.
- When your cat growls and growls in the hug, don't hold it tightly. Instead, switch to petting or cuddling. Cats can get used to quickly. Be careful not to upset the cat.
- If your cat is fussy or grumpy, talk as softly and as closely as possible every day if possible. You can brush, feed, or play with them.
- Cats may hide and appear only when alone or hearing a reassuring voice.
- If your cat is wagging its tail vigorously from side to side, this could mean he's angry or playful, so it's best to leave it alone.

> Warning
- Cats should be castrated or spayed in adulthood to avoid behavior problems and unwanted pregnancies. Male cats in particular need to castrate before going into heat to avoid later difficulty sterilizing when they are grown.
- Hold your cat very carefully, especially not too tightly when you pick it up. The tightening action is usually a sign of aggression and can result in severe scratches and injuries.
- Peeing, splashing, and littering in a prominent place is often the act of marking a cat's territory when it senses that it is being threatened by an alien or other pet. These could also be a sign of a urinary tract infection, cystitis, or other serious health problem. Then the cat needs to be treated or separated from another cat. You should consult with your veterinarian for a better understanding.
