> Cats need toys for exercise and entertainment. The best toys for your cat should simulate the skills your cat will need in the wild. Not all cats like toys, and some only like one toy. Finding a toy your cat likes can be expensive. The bright and colorful pet store toys are unnecessary and not necessarily good from the cat's perspective. You can bond with your cat and save money by making your own cat toys at home.

## 1. The pendulum

### 1.1 Cut the cardboard into a rectangle. 

Another option is to use the core of the toilet paper roll.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-2]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-2-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 1.2 Fold the cover in half and thread a string through the center. 

Thread the string so that you can suspend the cover while fixing the other end of the string. The toy should look like a pendulum when you swing in front of the cat.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-3]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-3-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 1.3 Pull the cover-up slightly above the string and fold down on the bottom. 

This will keep the cover on the string and won't slip off when you swing the toy.

### 1.4 Grab the other end of the string and swing it in front of the cat. 

The toy must be flexible and controllable so it looks as lively as possible. This will give your cat the feeling of catching prey.

## 2. The ball jingles

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-5]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-5-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Find an empty potion. 

Wash / peel off the label if it is still on the medicine bottle.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-6-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Open the vial and insert a small bell or two. 

Or you can replace bells with beads, dried beans, and raw corn kernels to make a click. This toy stimulates the fast movement of small prey. A click or tinkling inside will catch your cat's attention every time you throw a toy out, and your cat's hunting instincts will prompt her to chase.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-7-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Make sure the toy is tightly covered. 

If you are afraid your cat will be able to open the bottle even though it has a safety cap, you can tape it up with tape.

## 3. Cat puppet

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-8-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Find a small stuffed animal. 

Ideally, an animal with a shape that can stimulate chasing cats, such as mice. Stuffed toys made from materials similar to wool, fur, or wool are most appealing to cats. You will also need some extra glue and a small stick.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-9-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Cut a small hole in the bottom of the stuffed animal. 

Cut only one hole just enough to pass the stick.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-10-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 If the cotton is sticking out, remove it to prevent the cat from trying to pull it out, or eat it. 

Make sure your cat is safe when playing with toys and minimize the risk of choking.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-11-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Put a drop of glue on the tip of the stick. 

Stick the tip of the stick inside the stuffed animal and fix it in place.
- Tapes should not be used because gluing with duct tape is uncertain, and the tape or cotton inside can become a choking hazard. For the same reason, remove a stuffed animal's eye if it is made of plastic beads attached to the fabric. Your cat will not find it less like a mouse even without its bead eyes, and will not be able to chew or swallow it if you remove it in the first place.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-12-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Grab the tip of the stick and wave it in front of the cat. 

Let your cat pounce on or chew the toy. However, do not leave your cat alone with a toy, as it can injure herself.

## 4. The sock mounts

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-13-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 4.1 Wear an old sock for a few hours. 

Be sure to put on the socks long enough for your smell to stay on the sock.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-14-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 4.2 Keep a handful of catmint leaves in your hand. 

Hold the sock in your hand, while your fingers keep the catmint inside the sock.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-15-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 4.3 Drop a pinch of cat peppermint leaves on the toe part of the sock. 

Then turn the socks. No need to tighten too tight, just enough to wrap many layers.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-16-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 4.4 Grasp the fingertips of the sock with the catmint inside and pull the sock off. 

You will now have a new "layer" to add to the toy.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-17-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 4.5 Repeat this movement, adding a little more catmint in each layer. 

Not too much. Not all cats like catmint, but if one does, it is usually very sensitive to this plant.
- One theory is that cats get excited about catmint because the plant acts on the hypothalamus in the cat's brain and stimulates the cat's predatory response. Some studies have suggested that molecules in feline peppermint act as opioids in cats, stimulating the "pleasure" center in their brains. Not all cats are influenced by catmint. Only about 30-70% of cats react to catmint.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-18-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 4.6 Tie the knot at the top of the sock. 

You need to tie it in a little loose so that the cat has access to the mint. “Working” for food makes cats enjoy the hunting instinct that every cat has.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-19-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 4.7 Give your cat a toy. 

Some cats are "immune" to catmint, but others will not be able to resist the toy. Even if you don't like catmint, your cat will definitely enjoy playing with a toy.
- Your cat will smell your scent on the sock, and it will likely associate your smell with a pleasant and enjoyable experience playing with catmint; This makes it a great toy for your new cat.

## 5. Fishing toys

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-20-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 5.1 Poke a hole in the ball and thread a string through. 

Make sure the string is tight.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-21]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-21-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 5.2 Tie the other end and a stick. 

Be sure to choose a rope that is long enough to play this game.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-22]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-22-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 5.3 Grab the end of the line and move around the room. 

Like the jingle ball, this toy is designed to give a cat the impression of a hunter. The leash allows you to move the toy more flexibly, simulating a fast, and shaky mouse movement. 

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-23]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-23-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 5.4 Stick the stick on the board to let the cat play alone. 

This way your cat can play fishing when you're not there.

## 6. Feather tree

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-24]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-24-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 6.1 Find a long stick. 

The stick is as long as possible: you can allow your cat to scratch and grab the toy without scratching your hands or arms.
- Do not use a cat stick. This could result in serious injury to the cat. Therefore, you need to attach something soft to the tip of the stick like a cotton ball or a cuttable ball.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-25]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-25-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 6.2 Attach a small bunch of feathers to the stick. 

You can attach the bristles directly to the tip of the stick or attach it to a cotton ball or a ping-pong ball at the tip of the stick. Cats often like stuffed toys because they are similar to birds, a cat's natural prey.
- Glue is the strongest adhesive, but excess glue can make your cat seriously ill if swallowed. You may therefore need to use tape to attach the feathers to the stick.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-26]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-26-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 6.3 Hold the toy and shake it. 

You can pull the feather from the floor, hang it in the air, or let the cat play freely with the toy.

## 7. Motion light

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-27]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-27-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 7.1 Darken the room. 

Turn off lights and close windows if there is light outside. Do not worry; Cats can look very good in the dark!

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-28]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-28-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 7.2 Use flashlights or laser lights. 

You don't need something more interesting; Any light in the darkroom will appeal to your cat.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-29]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-29-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 7.3 Turn on the flashlight and move the light around the room. 

Cats have very good night vision, and light in the dark will stimulate their hunting instincts.
- Be careful when moving light to points in the room. Your cat may notice only the light, but not objects around the room.

## 8. Toy chase

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-30]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-30-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 8.1 Find a relatively long, elastic belt or large string, about 1 meter or more in length. 

Find an old stuffed animal. It's best to use a toy that you are not emotionally attached to, as your cat may tear the toy to pieces.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-31]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-31-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 8.2 Tie the stuffed animal to a rope or belt. 

Thread the string through the hole or just tie it around the toy.
- You can also use the ribbon.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-32]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-32-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 8.3 Play with toys. 

This toy has the same purpose as puppets and fishing toys; You can hold a rope or ribbon to control the toy, imitating the movement of real animals. This playstyle is very exciting and varied for cats. There are several options:
- Drag or wave in front of the cat (this works best for a kitten). Let the cat guess what it is and pull it away.
- You can use this toy to teach your kitten how to climb stairs leading up to a bed, shelf, or into a space designed for the cat. Giving your cat some space to "escape" the rest of the house is just as beneficial as playing.
- Drag the toy around the house. This helps if your cat wants to go out and you want it to be in the room. This is also a great game to tire your cat out.
- Tie the toy to the doorknob when you leave the house.

## 9. Toy mouse

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-33]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-33-Version-3.jpg.webp)

### 9.1 Find a sock, thread, catmint, scissors, and a needle. 

If a thread is not available, you can use sewing thread.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-34]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-34-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 9.2 Cut off the heels. 

Now the sock foot part looks like a bag. This will be the mouse body.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-35]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-35-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 9.3 Fill your socks with mint leaves. 

This step is up to you as your cat will probably enjoy chasing this rodent-shaped item with or without the charm of catmint. 

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-36]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-36-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 9.4 Use thread or thread to thread the hole in the sock. 

Stitch tightly. Tight or loose is up to you. Some cats may want to open the toy to get more direct access to the catmint, others may be willing to do so.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-37]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-37-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 9.5 Make mouse ears. 

Cut two circles from the heels cut out from the heels.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-38]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-38-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 9.6 Sew the ears close to the front of the toy. 

Now is the time to shape the toy.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-39]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-39-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 9.7 Twisted the neck of the sock to create a mouse tail. 

The "tail" can be sewn on to the mouse body, but sometimes you will have to open it for a replacement if you use catmint, so you can use a long, elastic bandage or ribbon to tie the tail.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-40]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-40-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 9.8 Give your cat a toy. 

Like other hunting toys, this toy will stimulate your cat's natural hunting instinct.

## 10. Toy birds are made of yarn

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-41]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-41-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 10.1 Collect materials. 

You will need smooth yarn, a sock, scissors, catmint leaf, needle, thread, and some feathers.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-42]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-42-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 10.2 Cut off the finger part of the sock. 

You can remove the finger as you do not need it when making this toy.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-43]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-43-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 10.3 Put catmint leaves in your socks and sew them up. 

As above, this step is optional, as the cat will play with anything that resembles its natural prey.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-44]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-44.jpg.webp)

### 10.4 Use thread wrapped around the sock. 

Tie one end of the thread sock and wrap it so that the sock is no longer recognizable. Also, use the string to tie the other end.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-45]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-45.jpg.webp)

### 10.5 Sew a few feathers to the body. 

Pick a few places to add more feathers. Thread the feathers under the loops and use the needle to stitch them in place. This also prevents the fibers from coming out.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-46]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-46.jpg.webp)

### 10.6 Wave the toy in front of the cat. 

Your cat will love this toy as it combines feathers with stuffed animals.

## 11. Create a new life for your old stuffed animal

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-47]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-47.jpg.webp)

### 11.1 Find an old and unpopular stuffed animal. 

Again, use a stuffed animal that you don't have a lot of love for, as your cat will tear the toy apart.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-48]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-48.jpg.webp)

### 11.2 Cut a small hole. 

If you know your cat likes catmint, put some in your stuffed animal. Stitched neatly.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-49]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-49.jpg.webp)

### 11.3 Use a string or ribbon around the toy if you want to drag your cat to play. 

This step is optional. Your cat may only enjoy playing alone or playing with a toy around the room. Finding the toy your cat likes the best can take time and patience.

![Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-50]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-make-cat-toys-out-of-common-objects/v4-728px-Make-Cat-Toys-out-of-Common-Household-Items-Step-50.jpg.webp)

### 11.4 Give your cat a new toy. 

If you have a rope attached, swing back and forth in front of the cat to allow it to "hunt".

> Advice
- The sock mount can also work without catmint leaves. Just roll up your socks and throw them to your cat.
- Twisted shoelaces are also a fun toy for cats.
- Kittens often play more than big cats. It is normal for an adult cat not to want to play, but give your cat a chance to play and don't ignore it.
- Jingle balls are great for blind cats or cats with poor eyesight. The ability to hear the toy will help your cat interact with the toy even if his eyes are not good.
- Some cats are content to play with simple stuffed animals. Try a variety of toys to determine what your cat likes best.
- Use balls. Tennis balls, ping pong, bouncy balls, polo balls, etc.
- Old beads or necklaces can also be a distraction. However, be aware that "toys" like these can cause choking.
- The scent is very important for cats. When making toys for your cat, find ways to incorporate scents as well as images, sounds, and touches into them. Include as many senses as possible.
- Leave a ping pong ball in the tub when you are not using it. Your cat will discover it and will be very excited! ( Do not add water).
- Crumple up some wrapping paper for the cat to catch and chase. Always supervise the cat while playing with paper or plastic to make sure the cat is not eating the toy.
- A gleaming, translucent piece of tape also delighted cats. Especially when you shine a flashlight on an object in a dark room. Be sure to watch out when your cat plays with this toy.

> Warning
- Never feed your cat grapes or chocolate.
- Some cats do not like toys, or just like to play alone without playing with people. Only play with the cat if it responds well to your efforts.
- Your cat may choke on a toy. It is important that you are very careful and always watch out for the cats are playing. Even ropes, ribbons and ribbons pose a choking hazard, and it is recommended that all handmade toys at home be played only under your supervision.
