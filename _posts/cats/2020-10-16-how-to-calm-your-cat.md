## 1. Choice of sedatives

### 1.1 Consult with a veterinarian. 

For most sedatives, you'll need a prescription from your veterinarian. Even if you buy over-the-counter medications, bring it to your veterinarian for moderation — poor quality products can endanger your cat's health. All animals on the verge of taking a medical sedative should have a health check by the veterinarian before use to ensure good health can be sedated.
- Inform your veterinarian that you are planning on bringing your cat calmly on board. The combination of air pressure, altitude, and excessive stress can cause an adverse reaction that has been shown to be potentially fatal.

### 1.2 Discuss timeframes with your veterinarian. 

Each medicine takes a different amount of time to work, so you need to know how well a particular medicine works. Ask your veterinarian about how long to give your cat a sedative before facing a stressful event. Some drugs work almost immediately, while others take about an hour to be effective.
- With medications that take time to work, your cat's stress can counteract the sedative if the cat is not in a relaxing environment.

### 1.3 Distinguish between sedative drugs. 

There are many different types of medications used to calm cats. All drug names mentioned herein require an examination and a prescription by a veterinarian. Discuss your options with your veterinarian to find out which is best for your pet. The veterinarian will use education, training, and experience to recommend certain medications with the least possible side effects and risks for the pet.
- Benzodiazepines are popular tranquilizers that relieve anxiety almost immediately. Side effects include disorientation, insomnia, and increased appetite. This type should be used with extreme caution in cats with liver or kidney problems.
- SARI also relieves anxiety quickly but can cause mild dizziness and disorientation. This type should be used with caution in animals with heart disease.
- Clonidine and Gabapentin are formulated to treat hypertension and neuralgia in humans but have sedative and anti-anxiety effects in animals.
- Chlorpheniramine is an allergy and cold remedy, while phenobarbital is an anesthetic and sedative used to treat epilepsy.

### 1.4 Do not expect the drug to work quickly. 

There are many over-the-counter medications available to calm your cat, most of which must be prescribed by a veterinarian. However, just like with humans, cats can react differently to drugs. This type works well for one cat, but it won't work for another. Make sure to have a sedative in your medication so you can adjust the medication if needed. Don't expect the "magic pill" to work right away.

## 2. Using Medicine to Calm your Cats

### 2.1 Take the test. 

You will need to test the medication before giving it to your cat. This step is to make sure your cat is responding well to the medication; otherwise, they may react badly in an already stressful situation. In general, you should spend at least a week of testing so you can go back and forth to your veterinarian and discuss some other medications if the original one doesn't work.
- Wait a while until you and the cat are both calm and relaxed.
- After giving the medication to your cat, you should observe it for 12 hours to assess the response to the medication.
- The cat should be relaxed and calm, but not dizzy or unconscious. If they become disoriented or frightened, you should no longer take the medication.

### 2.2 Prepare your cat for sedation. 

You should do this within the calming timeframes discussed with your doctor. Wait for the medication to work before a stressful situation occurs. Both you and your cat should be as comfortable as possible.
- Cover the cat in a small blanket, pillowcase, or towel so that only the head is left out.
- Keep the cat on the floor between its legs or thighs, or ask someone else to hold the cat.

### 2.3 Give your cat medicine. 

You should follow your veterinarian's dosage instructions carefully. These strong drugs have been shown to be harmful if used in the wrong doses.
- Place your thumb next to the cat's mouth, and your index finger on top
- Press gently until the cat opens its mouth.
- Use your other hand to gently press down on the lower jaw to open the cat's mouth open.
- Insert the pill or press the liquid pill into the mouth on the side of the cheek.

### 2.4 Make sure your cat swallows the pill completely. 

While holding the cat's body tightly, slowly bring your hand away from the cat's mouth. Lift her chin upwards, and gently rub her throat to encourage her to swallow the pill. You can also gently blow on your face to let them swallow quickly. Hold this position for a few seconds before removing the cover and returning the cat to its normal position.
- If your cat is licking his nose, this is a sign that he has swallowed the medicine.
- Praise your cat for his good behavior, and comfort him if he is unhappy about what just happened.

### 2.5 Use an alternative method of infusion if necessary. 

Cats are not in the habit of taking medications and may resist when you are trying to calm them down. You can cover the cat's body with a towel while administering the medication. When the cat is wrapped like a baby, it becomes unable to resist and runs away.
- You can buy a "potion gun" to release the pills to the cat's mouth to make it easier for them to take them.
- Put the medicine in cheese or another favorite treat in the cat's mouth.
- Ask your vet to prescribe liquid medicine if you are having trouble getting your cat to take pills.
- Consult with your veterinarian before mixing liquid medicine with cat food liquid. You need to make sure the food doesn't cancel out the medication.

### 2.6 Wait for the sedative to enter your cat's body. 

Medicines and doses take a different time to take effect. Your veterinarian will tell you how long the specific medication and dosage will take to enter your body and be effective. In general, your cat will be groggy and tired, but not disoriented and confused. They should be in a calm state, but not suddenly lose consciousness. Some cats sleep completely, while others are awake, but quiet and calm.
- The cat may return to normal in a few hours, or appear sleepy for the next few days.
- If your cat still does not return to normal after a few days, contact your veterinarian.

## 3. Using Non-Medicinal Comforting Methods

![Sedate-a-Cat-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-calm-your-cat/v4-728px-Sedate-a-Cat-Step-11-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.1 Use synthetic hormones at home. 

If your cat is anxious, over-excited, or otherwise behaves unexpectedly like scent marking or scratching, synthetic pheromones are the right solution. These chemicals instinctively mimic hormones that a cat's body instinctively produces to communicate with other cats. Some companies already use essential oils or herbal blends to regenerate hormones. If used regularly, it can make your cat feel calmer and safer at home.
- Synthetic hormones can be used in the form of a necklace, sprays, wipes, or an electric diffuser.
- Some of the best-known brands include Feliway, Comfort Zone, and Sergeant's Pet Care, among others.
- You can use pheromones at all times to keep your cat happy and calm. You can also take it out for a few weeks before a stressful event to calm your cat.

### 3.2 Consider using wraparound therapy. 

This method has been shown to be helpful in alleviating anxiety in cats. These products wrap around the cat's body, gently applying pressure to the points on the cat's body. The effect is similar to swaddling an infant. Although this line is commonly used for dogs, it still works on cats.

![Sedate-a-Cat-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-calm-your-cat/v4-728px-Sedate-a-Cat-Step-13-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Wrap your cat in a towel if you don't have a wrap. 

If you haven't bought a body wrap and the cat is worried or scared, you can simulate the effect using a large towel. Cover the cat's body with a towel, minus the head. You need to wrap the towel snugly around their body. This method can be used if you need to give your cat medication, cut its nails, or do something uncomfortable for your cat for a short period of time.
- Always praise your cat after removing the towel from her body.

### 3.4 Take a supplement to improve anxiety. 

The ingredients in the supplement support your cat's natural chemical balance to help him relax. Supplements come in liquid, chewable, or pill form. Two examples of dietary supplements include Anxitane and Zylkene.
- Anita is a green tea amino acid (according to the manufacturer) that works on chemical receptors in the brain to alleviate fear and anxiety in cats. 
- Zylkene is a dairy protein-based supplement that calms newborn cats.
- You can purchase a supplement online or at a veterinarian's office.

> Advice
- In some cases, it is best to combine both medicinal and non-pharmacological methods.
- Experiment ahead of time when you need to reassure your cat to find the best solution to their stressful problem.

> Warning
- Do not give your cat any human medications unless specifically instructed by your veterinarian. You can make your pet worse. Even worse, they can be fatal because the drug is safe for humans but toxic to cats.
- Do not reassure the cat to prepare for boarding.
- Be aware that this is not a sedative guide for a stray cat you will adopt at an animal shelter. They should be anesthetized prior to surgery or physical examination, but you should avoid direct contact to avoid severe skin abrasions or bites. It's best to bring both the stray cat and the cage to the veterinarian for sedation.
