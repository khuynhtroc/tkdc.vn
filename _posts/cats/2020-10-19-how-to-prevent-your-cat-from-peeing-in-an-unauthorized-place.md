## 1. Understand common litter tray problems

### 1.1 Think about how often you clean the tray. 

Cats don't like using dirty litter trays, and they may begin to pee when they need to go to the toilet and they get dirty. If you don't clean the litter box on a daily basis, it could be causing your cat to pee in the wrong place.
- In addition to daily cleaning your cat's litter from the litter box, you will also need to replace all the sand in the box once a week and rinse it with warm water and unscented soap or baking soda. When you've finished washing it, you need to dry the box and pour in clean sand.
- Try using a self-cleaning sand tray to make cleaning easier.

### 1.2 Count the number of sand trays in the house. 

You will need to use more than one litter tray compared to the number of cats in the house. For example, if you have three cats in your house, you need four litter boxes. If you have only two litter boxes and three cats in your house, that may be the reason why your cat refuses to use the litter tray to use the litter box.

### 1.3 Notice if your cat has easy access to the tray. 

If your cat has to go a long way to get to the tray or if the tray makes it difficult to get in and out, then that may be the reason your cat pee. You should place the cat's sand tray in a place where it is easily accessible in a hurry, such as a box at the top of the stairs and a box at the base of the stairs.
- Make sure your cat can see approaching people or animals and can easily run away. The cat does not like being cornered.
- Meet your old cat's needs with a low-walled litter box to make it easier for her to get in and out.
- Place the litter box near where the cat most often pee.

### 1.4 Find out if the sand you use is causing the problem. 

Cats may not use the litter tray because they dislike the smell or the texture of the sand, or because the tray is too full. A shallow layer of sand with medium or fine-grained sand is best, but you can also try different sand to see which they prefer.
- Give your cat a choice by placing two litter boxes side by side with two different types of sand. At the end of the day, check which box your cat uses.
- Use a sand tray containing a shallow layer of sand. Most cats like to use a litter box with sand about 2.5 to 5 cm thick.

### 1.5 Determine if the shape of the box is upsetting your cat. 

Some cats don't use the litter tray because they don't like the size and shape of the box. The liner under the sand tray can also make your cat uncomfortable. Remove the tray liner and cover to see what keeps it from defecating in.
- You should also consider the size of the sand tray. The tray is too small and may prevent your cat from using it.

## 2. Consider health and behavioral issues

### 2.1 Find out if stress is the factor causing your cat's problem with the litter tray. 

Your cat may be stressed by other pets, children in the house, or a noisy environment that makes them avoid the tray. You need to place the sand tray in a slightly dark, quiet, and isolated place. If the litter tray is in a place with lots of people or pets, the cat is less likely to go to the toilet.
- Try using the Feliway diffuser to help relax your cat. This product gives off a scent that many cats find pleasant.

### 2.2 Examine your cat's current and past health conditions. 

Your cat's medical history can tell you why your cat refuses to use the litter tray. If you suspect your cat is sick, get it to the vet as soon as possible. Treating the illness early will help resolve your cat's littering problem and also cure your cat of pain and discomfort. Urinary tract infections and interstitial cystitis in cats are common diseases that can cause your cat to pee outside of the litter box.
- A urinary tract infection can prevent your cat from using the litter tray, even if it is cured. Your cat may associate the litter tray with pain and want to avoid it.
- Cats' interstitial cystitis is another common cause of cats to hate litter trays. Cats with this disease may urinate out of the litter box because they have a need to urinate more often.
- A cat's kidney stones or urinary obstruction can also lead to an aversion to the litter box. Your cat may meow and howl with the litter box and the fear of pain persists even after the cat has been cured.
- Remember that prompt treatment for these disorders is essential so that your cat's cat litter aversion does not persist.

### 2.3 Find out if a cat's territorial habit is the cause of the problem. 

Urine-marked behavior manifests itself in a cat spraying a little bit of it from one place or another, or on furniture to claim its territory. The amount of urine will be much less than when they urinate normally. If your cat does this behavior, you will find many of the suggestions in this article really helpful, but there are some things you can do to prevent your cat from marking territory with urine.
- Territorial marking is most common in male cats that are not castrated, but unspayed female cats may also have this habit, so cat sterilization is important.
- Territorial marking is also common in homes that have ten or more cats, so limiting the number of cats in the house to less than ten may help with the problem as well.

## 3. Prevent your cat from urinating in an unauthorized place

### 3.1 Gradually move the position of the sand tray. 

If your cat begins to pee on the carpet or elsewhere in the house, place the litter tray in that position to encourage the cat to use it. After a month, inch up one inch each day until the tray is back where you want to place.

![Keep-Your-Cat-from-Urinating-Where-It-Shouldn't-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-your-cat-to-stop-behaving-badly/v4-728px-Keep-Your-Cat-from-Urinating-Where-It-Shouldn't-Step-10-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 3.2 Light them up in areas where cats are urinating. 

Cats love to go to a dark place to urinate, so the corner of the cupboard is a very attractive place for them. If your cat begins to pee on the floor or in a dark place, leave a light on or consider using motion trigger lights to prevent the cat from peeing in those places.

![Keep-Your-Cat-from-Urinating-Where-It-Shouldn't-Step-11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-your-cat-to-stop-behaving-badly/v4-728px-Keep-Your-Cat-from-Urinating-Where-It-Shouldn't-Step-11.jpg.webp)

### 3.3 Turn the staircase upside down or the decorative rugs. 

Your cat may develop a liking for a certain type of surface and begin to use it as a toilet. Turning the rugs upside-down may prevent your cat from peeing on it because of altered surface texture. You can try turning the mat upside down for a few days to see if the cat stops peeing on it.

![Keep-Your-Cat-from-Urinating-Where-It-Shouldn't-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-your-cat-to-stop-behaving-badly/v4-728px-Keep-Your-Cat-from-Urinating-Where-It-Shouldn't-Step-12.jpg.webp)

### 3.4 Stick double-sided tape on furniture. 

Double-sided tape may prevent your cat from urinating on it as he or she doesn't like the feel of the pads of the feet. Try sticking double-sided tape on the edges of furniture and on areas where your cat likes to pee.

![Keep-Your-Cat-from-Urinating-Where-It-Shouldn't-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-your-cat-to-stop-behaving-badly/v4-728px-Keep-Your-Cat-from-Urinating-Where-It-Shouldn't-Step-13.jpg.webp)

### 3.5 Clean your cat's urine with an enzyme cleaner. 

Cleaning immediately after the incident can also prevent your cat from peeing in the area next time. Use enzyme cleaners instead of ammonia-based cleaners. Ammonia-containing detergents may cause your cat to urinate more in the place because it thinks the smell of ammonia is the smell of another cat's urine and must be drowned out with her urine.

![Keep-Your-Cat-from-Urinating-Where-It-Shouldn't-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-your-cat-to-stop-behaving-badly/v4-728px-Keep-Your-Cat-from-Urinating-Where-It-Shouldn't-Step-14.jpg.webp)

### 3.6 Trim the fur around the cat's hind legs. 

If you are a long-haired cat, your cat may have a grudge against the litter box because it feels dirty after using the litter box. Keeping your cat's fur tidy can help her tolerate the use of the litter box. You can also bathe your cat so it doesn't smell like the smell of urine or feces.
- If you're having trouble bathing your cat, find a reputable cat grooming service near you.

### 3.7 Play with the cat near its litter box. 

You can improve your cat's negative association with the litter box by playing with the cat near the tray. A few times a day, play with your cat about 1 meter from the tray to help him feel positive about the tray.
- Don't try to reward your cat for going to the toilet in the sand tray with a treat. Cats generally do not like being disturbed when they are on the toilet.
- You can keep treats and toys for your cat near the tray, but do not place food and drink near the tray. Cats do not like eating or drinking too close to the toilet.

![Keep-Your-Cat-from-Urinating-Where-It-Shouldn't-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-train-your-cat-to-stop-behaving-badly/v4-728px-Keep-Your-Cat-from-Urinating-Where-It-Shouldn't-Step-16.jpg.webp)

### 3.8 Talk to your veterinarian if your situation does not improve. 

Encouraging your cat to use the litter box takes time and effort, but it doesn't always work out. Some veterinarians offer special training to help cat owners deal with problems like peeing out of the litter box. If your cat hasn't improved after a while, consider talking to an animal behavioral analyst or a veterinarian who specializes in animal behavior.

> Advice
- If you have a lot of cats and don't know which one is urinating badly, ask your veterinarian about fluorescein use to find out the culprit. Use ultraviolet light to check your cat's urine. Fluorescein will discolor the urine of certain cats, and that is a way to determine which cat is the culprit.
- Always wear gloves when handling the sand tray and removing sand. Wash your hands well with soap and warm water after you are done.
- Consider installing cat doors if your cat is kept inside or outside the home. Cat doors will make it easier for your cat to get out if he wants to defecate outside instead of indoors.

> Warning
- Do not rub urine on the cat's nose, do not lift the cat and place it in a litter box, or keep the cat in a tight room to find it. These measures will not solve the problem but also make the situation worse as the cat will have a negative relationship with the litter tray.
- Don't use ammonia-based cleaners to clean your cat's urine. This type of detergent may urge your cat to continue urinating in that area.
