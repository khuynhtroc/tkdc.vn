Furthermore, trips like these can jeopardize “indented” animals such as bulldogs and Persian cats as they may have trouble breathing in flight due to the flow. restrictive gas as well as stress. However, if you are moving to a new country and need to bring your cat with you, there is no way to bring them on the plane. There have been many horror stories about transporting cats on airplanes, but with careful preparation, your little friends can return home safely and intact.

## 1. Transporting Cats in the Airplane

![Transport-Cats-by-Plane-Step-1]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-transport-cats-by-plane/v4-728px-Transport-Cats-by-Plane-Step-1-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.1 Talk to the airline about carrying cats in the cabin. 

Contact the airline you are planning to fly with to see if it is possible to bring the cat in the carrier into the compartment under the seat in front of you. You should not transport cats in the cargo hold or if possible luggage.
- Most airlines will allow you to bring your cat on the plane for a small fee. You should call the airline before your flight time as the number of animals that can be carried onboard during flight is often limited.

### 1.2 Early flight booking. 

Some airlines often limit the number of pets that can be accompanied by a particular cabin on a particular flight. Early booking helps ensure your cat has a seat in advance. When choosing a seat, keep in mind that you won't be able to sit in the exit row or lean against the partition, as these seats usually place seats in front of passengers for transport.

### 1.3 Ask for the correct size under the airplane seat. 

The carrier will give you the exact size of the space under the seat. This will determine the size of your carrier for the cat.

### 1.4 Check the type of cage that can be carried on board. 

Most airlines generally approve a cage with hard or soft edges. Soft-sided housing is usually easy to slide under an airplane seat. But some airlines allow only a few types of pens with specific brands. Therefore, you should find out the type and brand name of the carrier that is allowed on the plane before deciding to buy.
- For the month before you fly, you should feed your cat in a carrier so that he or she will engage in positive action. Play with the cat in the carrier and let it lie or rest in it. This makes the cage a fun place for your cat.

### 1.5 Train your cat to step in and out of the cage. 

This helps them adjust to the cage and makes it a part of your cat's daily routine. Furthermore, access to the cage will familiarize your cat with security checks in case they need to get out or get inside the cage on command.

### 1.6 Schedule a visit to the vet near the date of departure. 

You will need to ask your vet for vaccination records of your cat and a health certificate to be eligible to travel. Airlines often require these types of documents to allow cats to board.
- Your veterinarian will provide a health certificate confirming that your cat is in good health and free from parasites. All cat vaccinations must be up to date, including rabies vaccinations. 
- Your veterinarian may also recommend microchip and body implants in case the cat is found quickly if it gets lost while in motion. This is the pet's lifelong identity. The microchip implantation is very simple with the vet process injecting a rice grain (12mm) microchip into the cat's skin surface, between their shoulder blades. This is painless and does not require anesthesia for the cat.

### 1.7 Do not feed the cat on the day of the trip. 

Traveling with a cat that has not eaten will limit the risk of nausea and vomiting. You can also bring some cat food with you, just in case, it gets too hungry while on the plane.
- Also, don't forget to bring your cat medication in a glossy plastic bag.

![Transport-Cats-by-Plane-Step-8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-transport-cats-by-plane/v4-728px-Transport-Cats-by-Plane-Step-8-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.8 Put an absorbent "sanitary pad" on the bottom of the cage. 

This pad is used to absorb the cat's waste while in flight. You should bring a few pieces, zipper bags, tissues, and rubber gloves in case it is necessary to clean up and store waste.

![Transport-Cats-by-Plane-Step-9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-transport-cats-by-plane/v4-728px-Transport-Cats-by-Plane-Step-9-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.9 Tag the bag on the cat's carrier. 

This step helps to identify your cat in case he gets lost in transit or at the airport. Write your name, address, phone number, and destination on the card.

![Transport-Cats-by-Plane-Step-10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-transport-cats-by-plane/v4-728px-Transport-Cats-by-Plane-Step-10-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.10 Bring a cat leash for airport security. 

The cat carrier has to pass through the baggage screening device at the airport, but the cat cannot. So you must attach the leash to the cat to prevent it from running away. Then, hold the cat in your arms and go through the body scanners.
- Before releasing the cat out of the cage, prepare your own personal belongings for the screening. Take off your shoes, make-up, and electronics and put the whole thing in a bin to run through the projector.
- Remove the pet from the cage, attach the leash, and pass the cage through the scanner.
- Hold the cat with you as you pass the human screening device. Then, find the cage and put the cat in it before picking up your belongings.

### 1.11 Give your cat a sedative if prescribed by your veterinarian. 

Most cats will normally walk without medication. However, some animals experience extreme stress while on the plane. If you are concerned about your cat's stress levels while in flight, talk to your veterinarian.
- Your veterinarian may prescribe Buprenorphine, Gabapentin, or Alprazolam for cats. Try giving your cat a pill at home before you get on the plane to see if it has a negative reaction to the medication.

![Transport-Cats-by-Plane-Step-12]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-transport-cats-by-plane/v4-728px-Transport-Cats-by-Plane-Step-12-Version-2.jpg.webp)

### 1.12 Use a bandage or pheromone to reduce agitation in your cat. 

If you do not want to give your cat medication, you can use the Thundershirt pad to wrap the cat's body, like wrapping a baby, to reduce stress and anxiety. 
- You can use a towel wrap or spray pheromone on the carrier before flying to help ease your cat's anxiety.
- You can buy a pheromone calming necklace to help your cat feel calmer while in flight.

## 2. Transport the Cat in the Cargo Storage

![Transport-Cats-by-Plane-Step-13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-transport-cats-by-plane/v4-728px-Transport-Cats-by-Plane-Step-13.jpg.webp)

### 2.1 Ask the airline to provide the animal transport incident report. 

While this is not a suitable measure, some airlines do not allow animals to be carried on the cabin, and if the cat is not sick, they can keep them in the cargo compartment on the plane. Most airlines in the United States are required to report all animal shipping incidents that occurred in cargo holds. You should research the employment profile of the airline you intend to book. If possible, choose a company with a low frequency of container animal transport problems.
- The animals transported in the cargo hold are often killed, injured, or missing on commercial flights every year. The temperature in the cargo compartment was too hot or too cold, as well as poor ventilation and careless handling were all causes of this accident. However, many cargo holds are now pressurized and have a fixed level of environmental control. Talk to your carrier about the cabin safety features that will make your cat feel more comfortable with her movements.

![Transport-Cats-by-Plane-Step-14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-transport-cats-by-plane/v4-728px-Transport-Cats-by-Plane-Step-14.jpg.webp)

### 2.2 Take a direct flight. 

This will help reduce the number of security checks you go through with your cat. It also helps to shorten the delays of taking pets off the plane, especially if they are transported in the cargo compartment.
- Always take the same flight with your pet. You can confirm this by asking the airline if you can observe the process of bringing your pet into the cargo hold before departure.
- Look for early morning or late night flights if you're going in the summer, as these are the coolest times of the day to keep your cat from feeling hot and crowded in the cargo compartment. When flying in winter, you should choose the afternoon time, because then the temperature in the compartment will be less cold to make your cat feel warmer.

![Transport-Cats-by-Plane-Step-15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-transport-cats-by-plane/v4-728px-Transport-Cats-by-Plane-Step-15.jpg.webp)

### 2.3 Wear a collar for your cat that contains your contact information. 

Choose a non-stuck door ring type and write your name, home address, phone number, and destination on the necklace. 
- You should also put a travel label on the carrier with the same information as before, in case the cage and cat get lost in transit.

![Transport-Cats-by-Plane-Step-16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-transport-cats-by-plane/v4-728px-Transport-Cats-by-Plane-Step-16.jpg.webp)

### 2.4 Trim your cat's claws before flying. 

This prevents the cat's claws from getting caught in the door, holes, and other crevices in the cargo compartment.

![Transport-Cats-by-Plane-Step-17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-transport-cats-by-plane/v4-728px-Transport-Cats-by-Plane-Step-17.jpg.webp)

### 2.6 Do not feed your cat 4-6 hours before leaving. 

Traveling with a cat that has not eaten will limit the risk of nausea and vomiting. You can give your cat some water to drink, or place ice cubes in the water dish in the cage to provide water for your cat.

![Transport-Cats-by-Plane-Step-19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-transport-cats-by-plane/v4-728px-Transport-Cats-by-Plane-Step-19.jpg.webp)

### 2.7 Bring the latest photos of your cat. 

If cats are lost or lost during flight or landing, the photo will help airport security personnel identify them.

![Transport-Cats-by-Plane-Step-20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/blog/cats/how-to-transport-cats-by-plane/v4-728px-Transport-Cats-by-Plane-Step-20.jpg.webp)

### 2.9 Notify the captain and at least one flight attendant that you have pets in the cargo hold. 

Proceed with notifications when you get on the plane. The captain may take special precautions when flying the aircraft, such as avoiding irregular areas while in the air.

### 2.10 Give your cat a sedative if prescribed by your veterinarian. 

Your veterinarian may prescribe an airborne cat medication like buprenorphine, Gabapentin, or Alprazolam.
- Try giving your cat a pill at home before you get on the plane to see if it has a negative reaction to the medication.

### 2.11 Open the door of the carrier as soon as you get off the plane and check on your cat. 

If anything goes wrong, you need to see your veterinarian immediately. Get the results in writing, including the date and time, in case you need to complain to the airline about the bad cat's treatment in the cargo hold.
